## Ç’është Delta Chat-i?

Delta Chat is a reliable, decentralized and secure instant messaging app,
available for mobile and desktop platforms.

- Instant creation of **private chat profiles**
  with secure and interoperable [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays)
  that offer instant message delivery, and Push Notifications for iOS and Android devices.

- Pervasive [multi-profile](#multiple-accounts) and
  [multi-device](#multiclient) support on all platforms
  and between different [chatmail apps](https://chatmail.at/clients).

- Interactive [in-chat apps](#webxdc) for gaming and collaboration

- [Audited end-to-end encryption](#security-audits)
  safe against network and server attacks.

- Free and Open Source software, both app and server side,
  built on [Internet Standards]({% include standards-url %}).


### How can I find people to chat with? {#howtoe2ee}

First, note that Delta Chat is a private messenger.
There is no public discovery, _you_ decide about your contacts.

- If you are **face to face** with your friend or family,
  tap the **QR Code** icon <img style="vertical-align:middle; height:1.3em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/qr-icon.png" />
  on the main screen.  
  Ask your chat partner to **scan** the QR image
  with their Delta Chat app.

- For a **remote** contact setup,
  from the same screen,
  click "Copy" or "Share" and send the **invite link**
  through another private chat.

Now wait while connection gets established.

- If both sides are online, they will soon see a chat
  and can start messaging securely.

- If one side is offline or in bad network,
  the ability to chat is delayed until connectivity is restored.

Congratulations!
You now will automatically use [end-to-end encryption](#e2ee) with this contact.
If you add each other to [groups](#groups), end-to-end encryption will be established among all members.


### Why is a chat marked as "Request"?

As being a private messenger,
only friends and family you [share your QR code or invite link with](#howtoe2ee) can write to you.

Your friends may share your contact with other friends, this appears as a **request**.

- Duhet të **pranoni** kërkesën, para se të mund të përgjigjeni.

- Mundeni edhe ta **fshini**, nëse s’doni të bisedoni me të tani.

- Nëse fshini një kërkesë, mesazhet e ardhshëm prej atij kontakti do të shfaqen
ende si kërkesë për mesazh, që të mund të ndërroni mendje. Nëse vërtet
s’doni të merrni mesazhe prej këtij personi, shihni mundësinë e **bllokimit** të tij.


### How can I put two of my friends in contact with each other?

Attach the first contact to the chat of the second using <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.0em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/paperclip.png" alt="Paperclip"/> **Attachment Button → Contact**.
You can also add a little introduction message.

The second contact will receive a **card** then
and can tap it to start chatting with the first contact.


### A mbulon Delta Chat-i figura, video dhe bashkëngjitje të tjera?

- Po Images, videos, files, voice messages etc. can be sent using the <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.0em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/paperclip.png" alt="Paperclip"/> **Attachment-**
  or <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:0.8em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/mic.png" alt="Microphone"/> **Voice Message** buttons

- Si parazgjedhje, për funksionim më të mirë, figurat optimizohen dhe dërgohen në madhësi më të vogël, por mund ta dërgoni si një “kartelë”, që të ruhet origjinali.


### What are profiles? How can I switch between them? {#multiple-accounts}

A profile is **a name, a picture** and some additional information for encrypting messages.
A profile lives on your device(s) only
and uses the server only to relay messages.

On first installation of Delta Chat a first profile is created.

Later, you can tap your profile image in the upper left corner to **Add Profiles**
or to **Switch Profiles**.

You may want to use separate profiles for political, family or work related activities.

You may also wish to learn [how to use the same profile on multiple devices](#multiclient).


### Kush e sheh profilin tim?

- Mund të shtoni një foto profili te rregullimet tuaja. Nëse u shkruani kontakteve
  tuaja ose i shtoni përmes kodi QR, e shohin automatikisht si foton e profilit tuaj.

- Për arsye privatësie, askush s’e sheh foton tuaj të profilit, deri sa
   t’u shkruani një mesazh.


### Can I set a Bio/Status with Delta Chat? {#signature}

Yes,
you can do so under **Settings → Profile → Bio**.
Once you sent a message to a contact,
they will see it when they view your contact details.


### Ç’do të thotë Fiksim, Heshtim, Arkivim?

Përdorini këto mjete për të sistemuar fjalosjet tuaja dhe për ta mbajtur gjithçka në vendin e vet:

- **Fjalosjet e fiksuara** qëndrojnë përherë në krye të listës së fjalosjeve. Mund t’i përdorni për të hyrë shpejt, ose përkohësisht te fjalosjet tuaja më të dashura, për të mos harruar gjëra.

- **Heshtoni fjalosje**, nëse s’doni të merrni njoftime mbi to. Fjalosjet e heshtuara qëndrojnë në vend dhe mundeni edhe të fiksoni një fjalosje të heshtuar.

- **Arkivoni fjalosje**, nëse s’doni t’i shihni më në listën tuaj të fjalosjeve.
  Fjalosjet e arkivuara mbesin të përdorshme mbi listën e fjalosjeve, ose përmes kërkimit. 

- Kur te një fjalosje e arkivuar vjen një mesazh i ri, do të **hapet jashtë arkivit** dhe kalojë te lista juaj e fjalosjeve, veç në mos qoftë e heshtuar.
  **Fjalosjet e heshtuara mbeten të arkivuara**, veç në i çarkivofshi dorazi.

Që të arkivoni ose fiksoni një fjalosje, prekeni gjatë (në Android), përdorni menunë e fjalosjes (në Android/Desktop), ose fërkojeni për majtas (në iOS);
që të heshtoni një fjalosje, përdorni menunë e fjalosjes (në Android/Desktop), ose profilin e fjalosjes (në iOS).


### How do "Saved Messages" work? {#save}

**Saved Messages** is a chat that you can use to easily remember and find messages.

- In any chat, long tap or right click a message and select **Save**

- Saved messages are marked by the symbol
  <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/saved-icon.png" alt="Saved icon"/>
  next to the timestamp

- Later, open the "Saved Messages" chat - and you will see the saved messages there.
  By tapping <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/go-to-original.png" alt="Arrow-right icon"/>,
  you can go back to the original message in the original chat

- Finally, you can also use "Save Messages" to take **personal notes** - open the chat, type something, add a photo or a voice message etc.

- As "Saved Message" are synced, they can become very handy for transferring data between devices

Messages stay saved even if they are edited or deleted -
may it be by [sender](#edit), by [device cleanup](#delold) or by [disappearing messages of other chats](#ephemeralmsgs).


### Ç’do të thotë pika e gjelbër?

You can sometimes see a **green dot** <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/green-dot.png" alt=""/>
next to the avatar of a contact.
It means they were **recently seen by you** in the last 10 minutes,
e.g. because they messaged you or sent a read receipt.

So this is not a real time online status
and others will as well not always see that you are "online".


### Ç’duan të thonë shenjat e shfaqura pas mesazheve që dërgohen?

- **One tick** <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.5em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/tick1.png" alt=""/>
  means that the message was sent successfully to your provider.

- **Two ticks**  <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.5em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/tick2.png" alt=""/>
  mean that at least one recipient's device
  reported back to having received the message.

- Recipients may have disabled read-receipts,
  so even if you see only one tick, the message may have been read.

- The other way round, two ticks do not automatically mean
  that a human has read or understood the message ;)


### Correct typos and delete messages after sending {#edit}

- You can edit the text of your messages after sending.
  For that, long tap or right click the message and select **Edit**
  or <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/edit-icon.png" alt="Edit icon"/>.

- If you have sent a message accidentally,
  from the same menu, select **Delete** and then **Delete for Everyone**.

While edited messages will have the word "Edited" next to the timestamp,
deleted messages will be removed without a marker in the chat.
Notifications are not sent and there is no time limit.

Note, that the original message may still be received by chat members
who could have already replied, forwarded, saved, screenshotted or otherwise copied the message.


### How do disappearing messages work? {#ephemeralmsgs}

You can turn on "disappearing messages"
in the settings of a chat,
at the top right of the chat window,
by selecting a time span
between 5 minutes and 1 year.

Until the setting is turned off again,
each chat member's Delta Chat app takes care
of deleting the messages
after the selected time span.
The time span begins
when the receiver first sees the message in Delta Chat.
The messages are deleted both,
on the servers,
and in the apps itself.

Note that you can rely on disappearing messages
only as long as you trust your chat partners;
malicious chat partners can take photos,
or otherwise save, copy or forward messages before deletion.

Apart from that,
if one chat partner uninstalls Delta Chat,
the (anyway encrypted) messages may take longer to get deleted from their server.


### Ç’ndodh, nëse aktivizoj “Fshi prej pajisjes mesazhe të vjetër”? {#delold}

- Nëse doni të kurseni hapësirë në pajisjen tuaj, mund të zgjidhni të fshihen
  automatikisht mesazhe të vjetër. 
- Për ta aktivizuar, kaloni te “fshi prej pajisjeje mesazhe të vjetër”, te rregullimet
  “Fjalosje & Media”. Mund të caktoni një periudhë nga “pas një ore” e deri
  “pas një viti”; në këtë mënyrë, *krejt* mesazhet do të fshihen nga pajisja juaj
  sapo të jenë më të vjetër se aq.

### How can I delete my chat profile? {#remove-account} 

If you are using more than one chat profile,
you can remove single ones in the top profile switcher menu (on Android and iOS),
or in the sidebar with a right click (in the Desktop app).
Chat profiles are only removed on the device where deletion was triggered. 
Chat profiles on other devices will continue to fully function. 

If you use a single default chat profile you can simply uninstall the app.
This will still automatically trigger deletion of all associated address data on the chatmail server.
For more info, please refer to [nine.testrun.org address-deletion](https://nine.testrun.org/info.html#account-deletion) 
or the respective page from your chosen [3rd party chatmail server](https://chatmail.at/relays).


## Groups {#groups}

Groups let several people chat together privately with **equal rights**.

Anyone can
change the group name or avatar,
[add or remove members](#addmembers),
set [disappearing messages](#ephemeralmsgs),
and [delete their own messages](#edit) from all member's devices.

Because all members have the same rights, groups work best among **trusted friends and family**.


### Krijimi i një grupi

- Prej menusë në cepin e sipërm djathtas, përzgjidhni **Fjalosje e re** dhe mandej **Grup i ri**, ose shtypni butonin përgjegjës në Android/iOS.
- Te skena vijuese, përzgjidhni **anëtarë grupi** dhe përcaktoni një **emër grupi**. Mund të përzgjidhni edhe një **avatar grupi**.
- Sapo të shkruani **mesazhin e parë** te grupi, krejt anëtarët marrin vesh për grupin e ri dhe mund të përgjigjen në të (për sa kohë që te grupi s’shkruani një mesazh i cili është i padukshëm për anëtarët).


### Add and remove members {#addmembers}

- All group members have the **same rights**.
  For this reason, everyone can delete any member or add new ones.

- To **add or delete members**, tap the group name in the chat and select the member to add or remove.

- If the member is not yet in your contact list, but **face to face** with you,
  from the same screen, show a **QR code**.  
  Ask your chat partner to **scan** the QR image with their Delta Chat app by tapping
  <img style="vertical-align:middle; height:1.3em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/qr-icon.png" /> on the main screen.

- For a **remote** member addition,
  click "Copy" or "Share" and send the **invite link**
  through another private chat to the new member.

QR code and invite link can be used to add several members.
However, since groups are [meant for trusted people](#groups), avoid sharing them publicly.


### Fshiva veten padashje.

- Ngaqë s’jeni më anëtar i grupit, s’mund të shtoni veten sërish. 
  Megjithatë, s’ka problem, thjesht kërkojini një anëtari tjetër të grupit në një fjalosje të zakonshme t’ju shtojë sërish.


### S’dua t’i marr më mesazhet e një grupi.

- Ose fshini veten si anëtar i listës, ose fshini krejt bisedën. 
  Nëse më vonë doni të ribëheni pjesë e grupit, kërkojini një anëtari tjetër të grupit t’ju shtojë sërish.

- Ndryshe, mundeni edhe ta "Heshtoni" një grup - duke bërë këtë, do të merrni
krejt mesazhet dhe prapë mund të shkruani, por nuk njoftoheni më, 
për çfarëdo mesazhesh të rinj.

### Cloning a group

You can duplicate a group to start a separate discussion
or to exclude members without them noticing.

- Open the group profile and tap **Clone Chat** (Android/iOS),
  or right-click the group in the chat list (Desktop).

- Set a new name, choose an avatar, and adjust the member list if needed.

The new group is **fully independent** from the original,
which continues to work as before.


## In-chat apps {#webxdc}

You can send apps to a chat - games, editors, polls and other tools.
This makes Delta Chat a truly extensible messenger.


### Where can I get in-chat apps?

- In a chat, using <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.0em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/paperclip.png" alt="Paperclip"/> **Attachment Button → Apps**

- You can also [create your own app](#create-xdc) and attach it using <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.0em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/paperclip.png" alt="Paperclip"/> **Attachment Button → File**


### How private are in-chat apps?

- In-chat apps can not send data to the Internet, or download anything.

- An in-chat app can only exchange data within a chat, with its
  copies on the devices of your chat partners. Other than that, it's completely
  isolated from the Internet.

- The privacy an in-chat app offers is the privacy of your chat - as long as you
  trust the people you chat with, you can trust the in-chat app as well.

- This also means: Just like for web links, do not open apps from untrusted contacts.


### How can I create my own in-chat apps? {#create-xdc}

- In-chat apps are zip files with `.xdc` extension containing html, css, and javascript code.

- You can extend the [Hello World example app](https://github.com/webxdc/hello)
  to get started.

- All else you need to know is written in the
  [Webxdc documentation](https://webxdc.org/docs).

- If you have question, you can ask others with experience
  in the [Delta Chat Forum](https://support.delta.chat/c/webxdc/20).


## Instant message delivery and Push Notifications {#instant-delivery}

### What are Push Notifications? How can I get instant message delivery?

Push Notifications are sent by Apple and Google "Push services" to a user's device
so that an inactive Delta Chat app can fetch messages in the background
and show notifications on a user's phone if needed.

Push Notifications work with all [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) servers on

- iOS devices, by integrating with Apple Push services.

- Android devices, by integrating with the Google FCM Push service,
  including on devices that use [microG](https://microg.org)
  instead of proprietary Google code on the phone.


### Are Push Notifications enabled on iOS devices? Is there an alternative?

Yes, Delta Chat automatically uses Push Notifications for [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) profiles.
And no, there is no alternative on Apple's phones to achieve instant message delivery
because Apple devices do not allow Delta Chat to fetch data in the background.
Push notifications are automatically activated for iOS users because
[Delta Chat's privacy-preserving Push Notification system](#privacy-notifications)
does not expose data to Apple that it doesn't already have.


### Are Push notifications enabled / needed on Android devices? {#android-push}

If a "Push Service" is available, Delta Chat enables Push Notifications
to achieve instant message delivery for all chatmail users.

In the Delta Chat "Notifications" settings for "Instant delivery"
you can change the following settings effecting all chat profiles:

- Use Background Connection: If you are not using a Push service,
  you may disable "battery optimizations" for Delta Chat,
  allowing it to fetch messages in the background.
  However, there could be delays from minutes to hours.
  Some Android vendors even restrict apps completely
  (see [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com))
  and Delta Chat might not show  incoming messages
  until you manually open the app again.
  
- Force Background Connection: This is the fallback option
  if the previous options are not available or do not achieve "instant delivery".
  Enabling it causes a permanent notification on your phone
  which may sometimes be "minified" with recent Android phones.

Both "Background Connection" options are energy-efficient and
safe to try if you experience messages arrive only with long delays.


### How private are Delta Chat Push Notifications? {#privacy-notifications}

Delta Chat Push Notification support avoids leakage of private information.
It does not leak profile data, IP address or message content (not even encrypted)
to any system involved in the delivery of Push Notifications.

Here is how Delta Chat apps perform Push Notification delivery:

- A Delta Chat app obtains a "device token" locally, encrypts it and stores it
  on the [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) server.

- When a [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) server receives a message for a Delta Chat user
  it forwards the encrypted device token to the central Delta Chat notification proxy.

- The central Delta Chat notification proxy decrypts the device token
  and forwards it to the respective Push service (Apple, Google, etc.),
  without ever knowing the IP or profile data of Delta Chat users.

- The central Push Service (Apple, Google, etc.)
  wakes up the Delta Chat app on your device
  to check for new messages in the background.
  It does not know about the profile data of the device it wakes up.
  The central Apple/Google Push services never see any profile data (sender or receiver)
  and also never see any message content (also not in encrypted forms).


The central Delta Chat notification proxy [is small and fully implemented in Rust](https://github.com/deltachat/notifiers)
and forgets about device-tokens as soon as Apple/Google/etc processed them,
usually in a matter of milliseconds.

Note that the device token is encrypted between apps and notification proxy
but it is not signed. 
The notification proxy thus never sees profile data, IP-addresses or
any cryptographic identity information associated with a user's device (token). 

Resulting from this overall privacy design, even the seizure of a chatmail server,
or the full seizure of the central Delta Chat notification proxy
would not reveal private information that Push services do not already have.


### Why does Delta Chat integrate with centralized proprietary Apple/Google push services?

Delta Chat is a free and open source decentralized messenger with free server choice,
but we want users to reliably experience "instant delivery" of messages,
like they experience from WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram apps,
without asking questions up-front that are more suited to expert users or developers.

Note that Delta Chat has a [small and privacy-preserving Push Notification system](#privacy-notifications)
that achieves "instant delivery" of messages for all chatmail servers
including a potential one [you might setup yourself without our permission](https://delta.chat/chatmail#selfhosted).
Welcome to the power of the interoperable chatmail relay network :)



## Multi-klient {#multiclient}

### A mund ta përdor Delta Chat-in në shumë pajisje njëherësh në të njëjtën kohë?

Po You can use the same profile on different devices:

- Siguroni që të dyja pajisjet të gjenden në të njëjtin rrjet Wi-Fi, ose me fill

- Te pajisja e parë, kaloni te **Rregullime → Shtoni Pajisje të Dytë**, shkyçni ekranin, në u dashtë
  dhe prisni një çast sa të shfaqet një kod QR

- Te pajisja e dytë, [instaloni Delta Chat-in](https://get.delta.chat)

- Në pajisjen e dytë, nisni Delta Chat-in, përzgjidhni **Shtoje si Pajisje të Dytë** dhe skanoni kodin QR që nga pajisja e vjetër

- Shpërngulja duhet të fillojë pas pak sekondash dhe, gjatë shpërnguljes, të dyja pajisjet do të shfaqin
  **ecurinë**. Prisni deri sa të përfundojë në të dyja pajisjet.

Ndryshe nga mjaft shkëmbyes të tjerë mesazhesh, pas një
shpërngulje të suksesshme, që të dyja **pajisjet janë plotësisht të pavarura.**
Njëra pajisja s’ka nevojë për tjetrën që të funksionojë.


### Diagnostikim

- Kontrolloni sërish që të dyja pajisjet të gjenden në **të njëjtin rrjet Wi-Fi ose klasik**

- On **Windows**, go to **Control Panel / Network and Internet**
  and make sure, **Private Network** is selected as "Network profile type"
  (after transfer, you can change back to the original value)

- On **iOS**, make sure "System Settings / Apps / Delta Chat / **Local Network**" access is granted

- On **macOS**, enable "System Settings / Privacy & Security / **Local Network** / Delta Chat"

- Sistemi juaj mund të ketë një “firewall personal”,
  që dihet se shkakton probleme (veçanërisht në Windows).
  **Çaktivizoni firewall-in personal** për Delta Chat-in në të dy anët dhe riprovoni

- **Guest Networks** may not allow devices to communicate with each other.
  If possible, use a non-guest network.

- If you still have troubles using the same network,
  try to open **Mobile Hotspot** on one device and join that Wi-Fi from the other one

- Garantoni se ka **depozitë të mjaftueshme** te pajisja vendmbërritje

- Nëse shpërngulja nisni, siguroni që pajisja **mbetet aktive** dhe nuk bie në gjumë.
  Mos mbyllni Delta Chat-in.
  (po punojmë fort për ta bërë aplikacionin të funksionojë në prapaskenë, por [sistemet priren t’i asgjësojnë aplikacionet](https://dontkillmyapp.com), për fat të keq)

- A është bërë **tashmë hyrja** te llogaria Delta Chat në pajisjen vendmbërritje?
  Mund të përdorni llogari të shumta për pajisje, thjesht [shtoni llogari tjetër](#multiple-accounts)

- Nëse keni ende probleme, ose **s’mundeni të skanoni një kod QR**
  provoni **shpërnguljen dorazi** të përshkruar më poshtë


### Manual Transfer {#backup}

Kjo metodë rekomandohet vetëm nëse “Shtoni Pajisje të Dytë” si përshkruhet më sipër s’funksionon.

- On the old device, go to "Settings -> Chats and media -> Export Backup". Enter your
  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. Then you can click on "Start
  Backup". This saves the backup file to your device. Now you have to transfer
  it to the other device somehow.
- On the new device, in the "I already have a profile" menu,
  choose "restore from backup". After import, your conversations, encryption
  keys, and media should be copied to the new device.
  - **If you use iOS:** and you encounter difficulties, maybe
    [this guide](https://support.delta.chat/t/import-backup-to-ios/1628) will
    help you.
- You are now synchronized, and can use both devices for sending and receiving
  end-to-end encrypted messages with your communication partners.


### A ka ndonjë plan për të sjellë një Klient Web Delta Chat?

- S’ka plane të afërta, por ca mendime paraprake.
- Ka 2-3 rrugë për sjelljen e një Klienti Web Delta Chat, por që të gjitha
  duan punë të madhe. Tani për tani, jemi përqendruar në pasjen e hedhjeve
  të qëndrueshme në qarkullim në krejt shitoret e aplikacioneve (depo 
  Google Play/iOS/Windows/macOS/Linux) si aplikacione origjinale të sistemit 
  përkatës.
- Nëse ju duhet një Klient Web, ngaqë s’keni leje të instaloni software në
  kompjuterin me të cilin punoni, mund të përdorni Klientin e bartshëm për
  Windows Desktop, ose AppImage për Linux. Mund t’i gjeni te
  [get.delta.chat](https://get.delta.chat).


## Advanced

### Experimental Features

At **Settings → Advanced → Experimental Features**
you can try out features we are working on.

The features may be **unstable** and may be **changed or removed**.

You can find more information
and give feedback in the [Forum](https://support.delta.chat).


### Can I use a classic email address with Delta Chat?

Yes, but only if the email address is used exclusively by [chatmail clients](https://chatmail.at/clients).

It is not supported to share usage of an email address with non-chatmail apps or web-based mailers,
for the following reasons:

- Non-chatmail apps are largely not accomplishing automatic end-to-end email encryption for their users,
  while chatmail apps and relays pervasively enforce end-to-end encryption and security standards.

- Non-chatmail apps use email servers as a long-term message archive
  while chatmail clients use email servers for ephemeral instant message relay.

- Supporting the full variety of classic email setups
  would require considerable development and maintenance efforts,
  and complicate making chatmail-based messaging more resilient, reliable and fast.

### How can I configure a chat profile with a classic email address as relay? {#classic-email}

First off, **please do not use the same classic email address also from non-chatmail classic email apps**
unless you are prepared to deal with encrypted messages in the inbox,
double notifications, accidentally deleted emails or similar annoyances.

You can configure a email address for chatting at **New Profile → Use Other Server → Use Classic Mail as Relay**.
Note that classic email providers will generally not support [Push Notifications](#instant-delivery)
and have other limitations, see [Provider Overview](https://providers.delta.chat).
Chatmail uses the default INBOX for relay; ensure the provider setup does too. 
A chat profile using a classic email address allows to to send and receive unencrypted messages.
These messages, and the chats they appear in, are marked with an email icon
<img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/email-icon.png" alt="email"/>.


### I want to manage my own server for Delta Chat. What do you recommend?

Any well behaving email server setup will do fine 
except if your users' devices require Google/Apple [Push Notifications](#instant-delivery) to work properly.

We generally recommend to [set up a chatmail relay](https://chatmail.at/doc/relay/getting_started.html). 
[Chatmail](https://chatmail.at) is a community-driven project that encompasses both the setup of relays
and [core Rust developments](https://github.com/chatmail/core) 
that power [chatmail clients](https://chatmail.at/clients) of which Delta Chat is the most well known. 


### What is "Send statistics to Delta Chat's developers"? {#statssending}

We would like to improve Delta Chat with your help,
which is why Delta Chat for Android asks whether you want
to send anonymous usage statistics.

You can turn it on and off at
**Settings → Advanced → Send statistics to Delta Chat's developers**.

When you turn it on,
weekly statistics will be automatically sent to a bot.

We are interested e.g. in statistics like:

- How many contacts are introduced by personally scanning a QR code?

- Which versions of Delta Chat are being used?

- What errors occur for users?

## Fshehtëzim dhe Siguri {#e2ee}

### Cilët standarde përdoren për fshehtëzim skaj-më-skaj? 

Delta Chat uses a [secure subset of the OpenPGP standard](#openpgp-secure)
to provide automatic end-to-end encryption using these protocols: 

- [Secure-Join](https://securejoin.delta.chat/en/latest/new.html)
  to exchange encryption setup information through QR-code scanning or "invite links". 

- [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org) is used for automatically
  establishing end-to-end encryption between contacts and all members of a group chat. 

- [Sharing a contact to a
  chat](https://github.com/chatmail/core/blob/main/spec.md#attaching-a-contact-to-a-message)
  enables receivers to use end-to-end encryption with the contact. 

Delta Chat does not query, publish or interact with any OpenPGP key servers. 

### How can I know if messages are end-to-end encrypted? {#whene2e}

All messages in Delta Chat are **end-to-end encrypted by default**.
Since the Delta Chat Version 2 release series (July 2025) 
there are no lock or similar markers on end-to-end encrypted messages, anymore. 

### Can I still receive or send messages without end-to-end encryption?

If you use default [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays),
it is impossible to receive or send messages without end-to-end encryption. 

If you instead use a [classic email server](#classic-email),
you can send and receive messages with or without end-to-end encryption.
Messages lacking end-to-end encryption are marked with an email icon
<img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/email-icon.png" alt="email"/>.


### What does the green checkmark in a contact profile mean? {#e2eeguarantee}

A contact profile might show a green checkmark
<img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.5em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/green-checkmark.png" alt="green checkmark" />
and an "Introduced by" line.
Every green-checkmarked contact either did a direct [QR-scan](#howtoe2ee) with you
or was introduced by a another green-checkmarked contact.
Introductions happen automatically when adding members to groups. 
Whoever adds a green-checkmarked contact to a group with only green-checkmarked members 
becomes an introducer. 
In a contact profile you can tap on the "Introduced by ..." text repeatedly
until you get to the one with whom you directly did a [QR-scan](#howtoe2ee).

For more in-depth discussion of "guaranteed end-to-end encryption"
please see [Secure-Join protocols](https://securejoin.delta.chat/en/latest/new.html)
and specifically read about "Verified Groups", the technical term
of what is called here "green-checkmarked" or "guaranteed end-to-end encrypted" chats.

### Are attachments (pictures, files, audio etc.) end-to-end encrypted?

Po

When we talk about an "end-to-end encrypted message"
we always mean a whole message is encrypted,
including all the attachments
and attachment metadata such as filenames.


### A është i siguruar OpenPGP? {#openpgp-secure}

Yes, Delta Chat uses a secure subset of OpenPGP
requiring the whole message to be properly encrypted and signed.
For example, "Detached signatures" are not treated as secure.

OpenPGP is not insecure by itself.
Most publicly discussed OpenPGP security problems
actually stem from bad usability or bad implementations of tools or apps (or both).
It is particularly important to distinguish between OpenPGP, the IETF encryption standard, 
and GnuPG (GPG), a command line tool implementing OpenPGP. 
Many public critiques of OpenPGP actually discuss GnuPG which Delta Chat has never used. 
Delta Chat rather uses the OpenPGP Rust implementation [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp),
available as [an independent "pgp" package](https://crates.io/crates/pgp),
and [security-audited in 2019 and 2024](#security-audits). 

We aim, along with other OpenPGP implementors, 
to further improve security characteristics by implementing the
[new IETF OpenPGP Crypto-Refresh](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh/) 
which was thankfully adopted in summer 2023. 


### Did you consider using alternatives to OpenPGP for end-to-end-encryption? {#openpgp-alternatives}

Yes, we are following efforts like [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security)
but adopting them would mean breaking end-to-end encryption interoperability.
So it would not be a light decision to take 
and there must be tangible improvements for users. 

Delta Chat takes a holistic "usable security" approach 
and works with a wide range of activist groupings as well as 
renowned researchers such as [TeamUSEC](https://teamusec.de) 
to improve actual user outcomes against security threats. 
The wire protocol and standard for establishing end-to-end encryption is
only one part of "user outcomes",
see also our answers to [device-seizure](#device-seizure)
and [message-metadata](#message-metadata) questions. 


### A mund të preket Delta Chat-i nga EFAIL?

Jo, [Delta Chat s’qe kurrë i cenueshëm nga EFAIL](https://delta.chat/en/2018-05-15-delta-chat-not-vulnerable-to-efail)
ngaqë sendërtimi në të i OpenPGP-së [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp) 
përdor Kod Pikasje Ndryshimesh, kur fshehtëzohen mesazhe
dhe shfaq [një gabim](https://docs.rs/pgp/latest/pgp/errors/enum.Error.html#variant.MdcError)
nëse Kodi i Pikasjes së Ndryshimeve është i pasaktë.

Delta Chat also never was vulnerable to the "Direct Exfiltration" EFAIL attack
because it only decrypts `multipart/encrypted` messages
which contain exactly one encrypted and signed part,
as defined by the Autocrypt Level 1 specification. 


### Are messages marked with the mail icon exposed on the Internet? {#tls}

If you are sending or receiving email messages without end-to-end encryption (using a classic email server),
they are still protected from cell or cable companies who can not read or modify your email messages.
But both your and your recipient's email providers
may read, analyze or modify your messages, including any attachments. 

Delta Chat by default uses strict 
[TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) 
which secures connections between your device and your email provider.
All of Delta Chat's TLS-handling has been independently [security audited](#security-audits).
Moreover, the connection between your and the recipient's email provider
will typically be transport-encrypted as well.
If the involved email servers support [MTA-STS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461)
then transport encryption will be enforced between email providers
in which case Delta Chat communications will never be exposed in cleartext to the Internet
even if the message was not end-to-end encrypted.


### Si i mbron Delta Chat-i tejtëdhënat në mesazhe? {#message-metadata}

Unlike most other messengers, 
Delta Chat apps do not store any metadata about contacts or groups on servers, also not in encrypted form. 
Instead, all group metadata is end-to-end encrypted and stored on end-user devices, only. 

Servers can therefore only see:

- the sender and receiver addresses
- and the message size.

By default, the addresses are randomly generated.

All other message, contact and group metadata resides in the end-to-end encrypted part of messages. 

### Si të mbrohen tejtëdhënat dhe kontaktet, kur shtien në dorë një pajisje? {#device-seizure}

Both for protecting against metadata-collecting servers 
as well as against the threat of device seizure
we recommend to use a [chatmail relay](https://chatmail.at/relays)
to create chat profiles using random addresses for transport. 
Note that Delta Chat apps on all platforms support multiple profiles
so you can easily use situation-specific profiles next to your "main" profile
with the knowledge that all their data, along with all metadata, will be deleted.
Moreover, if a device is seized then chat contacts using short-lived profiles
can not be identified easily. 

### Does Delta Chat support "Sealed Sender"? {#sealedsender}

No, not yet. 

The Signal messenger introduced ["Sealed Sender" in 2018](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/)
to keep their server infrastructure ignorant of who is sending a message to a set of recipients. 
It is particularly important because the Signal server knows the mobile number of each account,
which is usually associated with a passport identity.

Even if [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays) 
do not ask for any private data (including no phone numbers), 
it might still be worthwhile to protect relational metadata between addresses. 
We don't foresee bigger problems in using random throw-away addresses for sealed sending
but an implementation has not been agreed as a priority yet. 

### Does Delta Chat support Perfect Forward Secrecy? {#pfs}

No, not yet. 

Delta Chat today doesn't support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
This means that if your private decryption key is leaked,
and someone has collected your prior in-transit messages,
they will be able to decrypt and read them using the leaked decryption key.
Note that Forward Secrecy only increases security if you delete messages. 
Otherwise, someone obtaining your decryption keys
is typically also able to get all your non-deleted messages
and doesn't even need to decrypt any previously collected messages. 

We designed a Forward Secrecy approach that withstood 
initial examination from some cryptographers and implementation experts 
but is pending a more formal write up 
to ascertain it reliably works in federated messaging and with multi-device usage,
before it could be implemented in [chatmail core](https://github.com/chatmail/core),
which would make it available in all [chatmail clients](https://chatmail.at/clients). 

### Does Delta Chat support Post-Quantum-Cryptography? {#pqc}

No, not yet. 

Delta Chat uses the Rust OpenPGP library [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp)
which supports the latest [IETF Post-Quantum-Cryptography OpenPGP draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc/). 
We aim to add PQC support in [chatmail core](https://github.com/chatmail/core)  after the draft is finalized at the IETF
in collaboration with other OpenPGP implementers. 

### How can I manually check encryption information?

You may check the end-to-end encryption status manually in the "Encryption" dialog
(user profile on Android/iOS or right-click a user's chat-list item on desktop).
Delta Chat shows two fingerprints there.
If the same fingerprints appear on your own and your contact's device,
the connection is safe.

### A mund të ripërdor kyçin tim ekzistues privat? {#importkey}

No. 

Delta Chat generates secure OpenPGP keys according to the Autocrypt specification 1.1.
We do not recommend or offer users to perform manual key management.
We want to ensure that security audits can focus on a few proven cryptographic algorithms
instead of the full breadth of possible algorithms allowed with OpenPGP.
If you want to extract your OpenPGP key, there only is an expert method:
you need to look it up in the "keypairs" SQLite table of a profile backup tar-file.


### A është bërë auditim i pavarur i Delta Chat-it për cenueshmëri sigurie? {#security-audits}

Yes, multiple times. 
The Delta Chat project continuously undergoes independent security audits and analysis,
from most recent to older: 

- 2024 December, an [NLNET-commissioned Evaluation of
  rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/docs/blob/main/audits/NGI%20Core%20rPGP%20penetration%20test%20report%202024%201.0.pdf) by [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) took place.
  rPGP serves as the end-to-end encryption [OpenPGP](https://openpgp.org) engine of Delta Chat. 
  Two advisories were released related to the findings of this audit:

  - ["Panics on Malformed Untrusted Input"](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp/security/advisories/GHSA-9rmp-2568-59rv) CVE-2024-53856
  - ["Potential Resource Exhaustion when handling Untrusted Messages"](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp/security/advisories/GHSA-4grw-m28r-q285) CVE-2024-53857

  The issues outlined in these advisories have been fixed and are part of Delta Chat 
  releases on all appstores since December 2024. 

- 2024 March, we received a deep security analysis from the Applied Cryptography
  research group at ETH Zuerich and addressed all raised issues. 
  See our blog post about [Hardening Guaranteed End-to-End encryption](https://delta.chat/en/2024-03-25-crypto-analysis-securejoin) for more detailed information and the
  [Cryptographic Analysis of Delta Chat](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/918.pdf) 
  research paper published afterwards. 

- Në fillim të 2023-shit, ndreqëm probleme sigurie dhe privatësie me
  veçorinë “aplikacione web dhënë në një fjalosje”, të lidhura me dështime
  në izolimin e tyre, veçanërisht nën Chromium. Në vazhdim kaluam një auditim
  të pavarur sigurie prej Cure53 dhe krejt problemet e gjetura u ndreqën në
  seritë 1.36 të hedhura në qarkullim në prill të 2023-shit. 
  Shihni [këtu, për shpjegim të plotë të sfondit për sigurinë lidhur me E2E në web](https://delta.chat/en/2023-05-22-webxdc-security).

- Në fillim të 2023-it, [Cure53](https://cure53.de) analizoi qoftë fshehtëzimin

  ose të lexoni [raportin e plotë këtu](../assets/blog/MER-01-report.pdf).

- Më 2020-n, [Include Security](https://includesecurity.com) analizoi [bazën](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/)
  në Rust të Delta Chat-it, si dhe bibliotekat [IMAP](https://github.com/async-email/async-imap), [SMTP](https://github.com/async-email/async-smtp)
  dhe [TLS](https://github.com/async-email/async-native-tls).
  S’gjeti ndonjë problem kritik apo të rëndësisë së madhe.
  Raporti ngriti pak dobësi të rëndësisë mesatare -
  ato në vetvete s’përbëjnë kërcënim për përdoruesit e Delta Chat-it
  ngaqë varen në mjedisin në të cilin përdoret Delta Chat-i.
  Për arsye përputhjeje dhe përdorimi,
  s’mund t’i shmangim krejt ato
  dhe vendosëm të ofrojmë rekomandime sigurie për përdoruesit e kërcënuar.
  Mund të lexoni [raportin e plotë këtu](../assets/blog/2020-second-security-review.pdf).

- Më 2019-n, [Include Security](https://includesecurity.com) analizoi libraritë
  [PGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp) dhe
  [RSA](https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA) të Delta Chat-it.
  S’gjeti probleme kritike,
  por dy çështje me rëndësi të lartë që i ndreqim në vazhdim.
  Nxori gjithashtu një çështje të rëndësisë mesatare dhe disa çështje me më pak rëndësi,
  por s’kishte ndonjë rrugë për t’i shfrytëzuar këto cenueshmëri në sendërtimin e Delta Chat-it.
  Pavarësisht, disa nga këto i ndreqëm që kur përfundoi auditimi.

### Si financohet zhvillimi i Delta Chat-it? 

Delta Chat nuk përfiton ndonjë financim të llojit Venture Capital dhe s’ka
borxhe, as gjendet nën trysni për të prodhuar fitime të mëdha, apo për të
shitur përdoruesit, shokët dhe familjen e tyre reklamuesve (apo më keq). 
Në vend të kësaj, përdorim burime financimi publik, deri sot me origjinë nga
BE dhe ShBA, si ndihmë të përpjekjeve tona për lulëzimin e një ekosistemi të
decentralizuar dhe të larmishëm shkëmbimi mesazhesh bazuar në zhvillime
bashkësie të Lirë dhe Me Burim të Hapët.

Concretely, Delta Chat developments have so far been funded from these sources,
ordered chronologically: 

- The [NEXTLEAP](https://nextleap.eu) EU project funded the research
  and implementation of verified groups and setup contact protocols
  in 2017 and 2018 and also helped to integrate end-to-end Encryption
  through [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org).

- [Open Technology Fund](https://opentechfund.org) na dha grantin e parë 
  për 2018/2019 (~200 mijë dollarë) me të cilin përmirësuam ndjeshëm aplikacionin
  për Android dhe hodhëm në qarkullim një version të parë beta aplikacioni për Desktop,
  si dhe i afroi më tepër zhvillimet tona për veçori me kërkime UX në kontekste të drejtash të njeriut, 
  shihni [raportin tonë përfundimtar “Needfinding and UX”](https://delta.chat/en/2019-07-19-uxreport).
  Granti i dytë për 2019/2020 (~$300K) na ndihmoi të hedhim në qarkullim 
  versione Delta/iOS, për të shndërruar bibliotekën tonë bazë në Rust, si dhe
  për të sjellë veçori të reja për krejt platformat.  

- The [NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) granted in 2019/2020 EUR 46K for
  completing Rust/Python bindings and instigating a Chat-bot eco-system. 

- In 2021 we received further EU funding for two Next-Generation-Internet
  proposals, namely for [EPPD - email provider portability directory](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/eppd/) (~97K EUR) and [AEAP - email address porting](https://nlnet.nl/project/EmailPorting/) (~90K EUR) which resulted in better multi-profile support, improved QR-code contact and group setups and many networking improvements on all platforms.

- From End 2021 till March 2023 we received *Internet Freedom* funding (500K USD) from the
  U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL). 
  This funding supported our long-running goals to make Delta Chat more usable 
  and compatible with a wide range of email servers world-wide, and more resilient and secure
  in places often affected by internet censorship and shutdowns.

- 2023-2024 we successfully completed the OTF-funded 
  [Secure Chatmail project](https://www.opentech.fund/projects-we-support/supported-projects/secure-chat-mail-with-delta-chat/), 
  allowing us to introduce guaranteed encryption, 
  creating a [chatmail server network](https://delta.chat/chatmail) 
  and providing "instant onboarding" in all apps released from April 2024 on. 

- In 2023 and 2024 we got accepted in the Next Generation Internet (NGI)
  program for our work in [webxdc PUSH](https://nlnet.nl/project/WebXDC-Push/),
  along with collaboration partners working on 
  [webxdc evolve](https://nlnet.nl/project/Webxdc-Evolve/), 
  [webxdc XMPP](https://nlnet.nl/project/WebXDC-XMPP/), 
  [DeltaTouch](https://nlnet.nl/project/DeltaTouch/) and 
  [DeltaTauri](https://nlnet.nl/project/DeltaTauri/). 
  All of these projects are partially completed or to be completed in early 2025. 

- Ndonjëherë marrim dhurime unike nga individë privatë. 
  Për shembull, më 2021-shin një individ bujar na dërgoi një dërgesë
  bankare prej 4K eurosh me subjektin “vazhdoni zhvillimin e mbarë!”. 💜 
  Këto para i përdorim për të zhvilluar takime, ose mbuluar shpenzime <em>ad-hoc</em>
  që s’mund të parashikohen kollaj, ose të rimbursohen nga grante financimesh publike. 
  Marrja e më shumë dhurimeve na ndihmon gjithashtu të bëhemi më të pavarur dhe
  të jetëgjatë, si bashkësi kontribuesish. 

  [Dhuroni Para](donate){: .cta-button}

- E fundit, por aspak për nga rëndësia, disa ekspertë dhe entuziastë kanë dhënë
  dhe japin ndihmesë pro-bono në zhvillimin e Delta Chat-it pa përfituar para,
  ose vetëm shuma të vogla. Pa ta, Delta Chat-i s’do të ish atje ku është sot,
  madje as afër asaj. 

Financimi monetar i përmendur më sipër është kryesisht i organizuar nga GmbH në
Frajburg (Gjermani) dhe u shpërndahet më tepër se një duzine kontribuesish nga e gjithë bota. 

Për mundësi kontributesh monetare ose lloji tjetër, ju lutemi, shihni
