Chatmail servers provide a privacy-preserving and speedy messaging experience, 
securely interoperable with chatmail and classic e-mail servers. 
**Tap a chatmail server link** to see the home page and then tap the QR invite code there: 

- [nine.testrun.org](https://nine.testrun.org) is the default onboarding chatmail server
  for Delta Chat apps and has been stable since the [December 2023 Chatmail announcement](https://delta.chat/en/2023-12-13-chatmail).

There are additional chatmail servers not listed publically.  

All chatmail servers are operated by different groups and people. 


## Can I also use a pre-existing e-mail address? 

Yes, you can use a pre-existing e-mail address with Delta Chat
but we recommend to use a **dedicated e-mail address for chatting**
so that your classic usually un-encrypted e-mail does not mix 
with end-to-end encrypted chat messages. 

You may also use Delta Chat as a (cleartext) e-mail app for an existing e-mail address. 

Delta Chat has multi-profile support so you can have 
one profile with your classic e-mail address,
and another for instant always-encrypted chatting. 
Chatmail addresses are cheap.
