## Delta Chat forum

We also provide a forum for you to join discussions. For this purpose, we use the open source software “Discourse”. We process personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide the functions of the platform "Discourse".

### a) Registration

In the registration process, we collect your username, password and e-mail address. When register at the platform, you will enter into a user agreement for the purpose of processing your profile data. [Art.6 (1) lit.b GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) serves as the legal basis for this. The registration and the resulting storage of data is necessary for the use of the platform. We cannot provide this service without this data. The data provided will be stored by us until you request anonymization or deletion of your user account.

At the end of the fifth calendar year after these posts were written or after the deletion of your user account, anonymization will take place, i.e. the author of the post will be listed as "Anonymous". If the post still contains personal data despite anonymization, users are entitled to have the post deleted or modified in the individual case.

All posts that you write, the time since your registration, the Likes received and awards for particularly popular posts are recorded. In addition, to prevent bots and spam, the reading time is recorded and other data regarding the misuse of our forum, including the frequency of posts in relation to an implausibly short period of time, implausibly high number of web links or use of words on a blocked word list, etc. are recorded.
