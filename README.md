Delta Chat Website
================================================================================

This repository contains the default website of Delta Chat -
feel free to edit any file as you like and send a pull request.

Formatting of blog posts and web pages
--------------------------------------

In the various source text files that are used 
for generating the static https://delta.chat website 
we use [Semantic linefeeds](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/)
to keep "diffs" for changes small. The gist of it is
that you put each "phrase" part of a sentence into a single line.


How to create a new blog post
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In the directory `_posts` create new file in the form `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` 
  e.g by copying an existing file.

- Write your blog post to the file and do not forget 
  to add or modify the `title:` and `author:` line atop it.

- That's all, the result goes to https://delta.chat/en/blog , and the
  [RSS-Feed](https://delta.chat/feed.xml). Ping r10s or compl4xx on
  irc.freenode.net/#deltachat so they post it to
  [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@delta),
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/delta_chat), and other services.


Testing changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You can create your fork on GitHub and GitHub pages; 
  the forked website will then be available at 
  `https://<your-username>.github.io/deltachat-pages/`

- Alternatively, [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) 
  on your local machive, run `bundle install` in this directory, 
  and execute `jekyll serve --destination <path-to-build-dir>` 
  in the source directory.

Directory structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- `/en` - Contains the source language files in Markdown. Can be edited directly.

- `/de`, `/es`, `fr` … - Contain the translated files, use Transifex to edit them;
  you **MUST NOT** edit any file in these directories,
  they will be overwritten with the next pull from Transifex.

- `/_layouts` - This directory contains a default layout template 
  for each language (the layout is referenced in Markdown using _layout: name_)

- `/assets` - Page specific images and files; 
  in general, we use one subdirectory per page or section.

- `/assets/css` - CSS and layout specific images and files.


Translate the website
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can edit and improve the existing translations 
with [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/delta-chat/delta-chat-pages/). 
To **update existing translations from** the Transifex server, 
see the scripts in the `tools` folder.

### Before you run anything follow these initial setup steps:

- make sure `translate-toolkit` and `transifex-client` are installed

- run following commands
```
tx init --user=api --pass=<your api token>
tx set --auto-remote https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/delta-chat-pages/
```
for more info see the comments in `./tools/t-dance.sh`.

### To **add a new language**, the followinging steps are required once:

- create the directory `/<lang>`

- add the language to `tlangs` in `/tools/t-dance.sh` 
  and run `./t-dance.sh pull` from the `tools`-directory.

- check the language selection in `/_includes/footer-languages.html`.

### To **add a new page**:

- create the source as `en/<name>.md`

- modify `tools/.tx/config` - add a section for the new page
  modify `tools/t-dance.sh` - add your page to `sfiles` variable

- run `cd tools; ./t-dance push`


Further Hints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- wherever possible, use **Markdown** instead of HTML, 
  esp. in files for translation.

- **no JavaScript** wherever possible, 
  no **weird CSS** nor other complicated things.

- the layout should be **as simple as possible** 
  and should always work on **small mobile screens** as well as on **desktops**.

- when layouting, do not force a special structure. Header, Content, Footer - done.

- no complex navigation - Simply link subpages from the main pages.

- **no one-page-layout** - we also have sites with long text, 
  and we do not want to have separate layouts.

- we do not want a complex navigation, some toplinks, a footer, done.

- Remember: **Form follows function, KISS.** The site should be dead-simple.

- Finally: Have fun :)
