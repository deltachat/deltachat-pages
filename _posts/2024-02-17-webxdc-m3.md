We've just refined and created several webxdc-development related resources: 

- The new [webxdc.org/apps](https://webxdc.org/apps) page 
  provides a search and download interface -- you can 
  attach a downloaded file to a chat message, enabling 
  chat-group members to run the app without them having
  to visit the apps-page or download anything. 

- The new [Shared Web application state](https://webxdc.org/docs/shared_state/index.html) 
  chapter walks you through the theory and practise 
  of using a P2P send/receive networking model 
  instead of the centralizing HTTP client/server request model. 
  The bulk of the new chapter was written by [ansuz](https://social.cryptography.dog/@ansuz)
  also known for being development lead of Cryptpad for many years. 

- The refined [webxdc.org/docs](https://webxdc.org/docs) page
  now begins with a "getting-started" page 
  that allows to create and run your first web app within minutes. 
  The docs generally got re-arranged and the 
  [webxdc specification](https://webxdc.org/docs/spec/index.html)
  now has table-of-content sections to ease discovery. 
  It's still a very small spec you can read in a quarter hour, no worries :) 

- The [webxdc.org](https://webxdc.org) site was simplified,
  points to "try out apps" and "develop own app" documentation,
  and generally the whole site is not Delta Chat specific anymore
  because all apps run on [the XMPP-messenger Cheogram](https://cheogram.com) as well. 

## A basic cross-platform Editor using Prosemirror and yjs

In around 400 lines of Code, 
the [webxdc/editor](https://codeberg.org/webxdc/editor/src/branch/main/src) 
implements a fully functioning end-to-end encryption offline-first editor
that you can use in any chat group to collaboratively edit. 
The editor uses the [y-webxdc provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/y-webxdc) 
which allows easy integration of [yJS](https://yjs.dev/#features),
a Conflict-free-Replicable-Data-Types (CRDT) implementation, also discussed in the 
[Shared Web application state](https://webxdc.org/docs/shared_state/index.html) 
chapter.
