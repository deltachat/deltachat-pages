The 1.44 releases on all stores and platforms and bring
several often-requested usage improvements.
We keep it brief because it's so much :) 

## Reactions ❤️  now supported on all platforms 

Desktop and iOS apps can now send arbitrary reactions 
on chat messages and surpassed Android support 
which only offers a default set of reactions to send. 
All platforms now show reactions.

## Instant message delivery on Apple iOS devices

The new Delta Chat 1.44 iOS app features instant message delivery,
addressing the long-lasting usability issue of 
"i didn't see your message and had to open the app first".
Note that instant message delivery is currently 
only available if you are using a chatmail address,
as provided by https://nine.testrun.org, 
https://mailchat.pl or https://mehl.cloud .

## Much improved Desktop Multi-account handling 

The Desktop apps on all platforms now have an account sidebar
so that changing an account is a single click
and you also maintain a direct overview of unread messages. 
Moreover, system notifications now work, including on Flathub 
where some bugs in system integration got fixed. 
Using multiple accounts has never been easier!

## Invite links for getting in contact 

You can now send invite links via any other messenger 
or social media channel you have with friends,
no need to show/scan a QR code although this is
still a good option if you are standing next to each other 
or are in a video call. 
If a receiver clicks or taps your invite link 
a [guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chat](https://delta.chat/en/2023-11-23-jumbo-42) 
will be established and both can message each other
without typing in any address and without ever using non-encrypted messages.

## Privacy preserving statistics on Android 

Android has a new "Send statistics to Delta Chat's developers" option
which performs some encryption related statistics in order to ensure
we weed out any "failed to decrypt" style messages. 
Guaranteed end-to-end encryption should "just work" 
and also not cause any troubles on multi-device usage. 
You can help by going to "Send statistics" options in "Advanced settings". 
Statistics are generated as a text message which you sent yourself 
to the [collection bot](https://github.com/deltachat/self_reporting_bot/blob/main/self_reporting_bot.py) using guaranteed end-to-end encryption. 
No personally identifable data remains as your reporting message 
is removed on the collection-side after processing.
