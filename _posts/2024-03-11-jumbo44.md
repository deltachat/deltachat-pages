The 1.44 releases on all stores and platforms bring
several often-requested improvements.
We keep talking about each one only briefly because there are so many :) 

## Reactions ❤️  now supported on all platforms 

![Select reactions to chat message](../assets/blog/desktop-reactions.png)

Desktop, iOS and UbuntuTouch apps can now send arbitrary reactions 
on chat messages and surpassed Android support 
which only offers a default set of reactions to send. 
Fun fact: we use the IETF [RFC9078](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9078.html) 
experimental standard for transmitting reactions in e-mail. 
See [Delta Chat standards](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/main/standards.md)
for a list of other interoperability specs we are tapping into. 


## Instant message delivery on Apple iOS devices

The new Delta Chat 1.44 iOS app features instant message delivery,
addressing the long-lasting usability issue of 
"I didn't see your message and had to open the app first!".
Note that instant message delivery is currently 
only available if you are using a chatmail address,
as provided by three independent entities currently: 
[nine.testrun.org](https://nine.testrun.org),
[mailchat.pl](https://mailchat.pl) or [mehl.cloud](https://mehl.cloud)


## New Desktop Multi-account sidebar

The Desktop apps on all platforms now have a sidebar
that shows and allows to select all your accounts,
and eases a direct overview of unread messages in any accounts. 
System notifications now work for all accounts and you can also mute less important accounts.
We also fixed many issues, including the Flathub release (which crashed when receiving messages).

## Invite links for getting in contact 

![Invite link in Whatsapp](../assets/blog/desktop-invite-link-show.jpg)

You can now send invite links via any other messenger 
or social media DM channel. 
To create an invite link go to the "QR code" icon 
and tap "share" to a link you can send via other messengers
or other private channels.
If a receiver taps on your invite link Delta chat will automatically activate
and offer to accept the invite and establish 
a [guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chat](https://delta.chat/en/2023-11-23-jumbo-42). 
Of course, you can still use the regular show/scan QR code option
if you are standing next to each other. 

## Privacy preserving statistics on Android 

![Submit encryption statistics to developers](../assets/blog/self-reporting-statistics.jpg)

Android has a new "Send statistics to Delta Chat's developers" option
which performs some encryption related statistics in order to ensure
we weed out and prevent any unneccessary "failed to decrypt" style messages. 
Guaranteed end-to-end encryption should "just work" 
and also not cause any troubles with multi-device usage. 
You can help by going to "Send statistics" options in "Advanced settings". 
Statistics are generated as a text message which you send yourself 
to the [collection bot](https://github.com/deltachat/self_reporting_bot/blob/main/self_reporting_bot.py) using guaranteed end-to-end encryption. 
No personally identifable data remains as your statistics reporting message 
is removed on the collection-side after processing. 

# Other useful improvements with 1.44 
 
- Delta Android now signals how many unread messages are in other accounts 

- Better and localized error messages if you try to send un-encrypted
  messages from a chatmail address that only allows outgoing mails in
  encrypted form

- Improved Desktop "settings" dialog and many other Desktop and iOS UI refinements 

- Creating contacts and changing your avatar now syncs to all your devices. 

- Many bug fixes
