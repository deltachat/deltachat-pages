<!-- toot: make fun of Musk's X-thing: while some billionaires are talking about everything-apps, we are delivering it: [xstore@testrun.org](mailto:xstore@testrun.org) -->


It doesn't need to be hard to write, distribute or find end-to-end encrypted apps anymore. 
If you use Delta Chat it's dead simple: 

![In the store app, you can see a list of apps.](../assets/blog/2023-08-xstore-applist.png)

1. Say ["hi" to our beta xstore@testrun.org bot](mailto:xstore@testrun.org?body=hi)
   and hit "Start" on the returned "store app".

2. Select a game or collaborative tool for download.

3. Share the downloaded app to any chat so everyone there 
   can **Start** it without any logins, cookie or GDPR screens!

[Rest-assured](https://delta.chat/en/2023-05-22-webxdc-security), 
nobody else than your chat partners will know 
that you are running an app together;
there is no server or app-specific hosting, 
no developer or store can track app usage,
and all app interactions are end-to-encrypted. 

Others are hand-wavingly talking about so called "super-app" or "everything app" architectures, 
but we are delivering it today, 
decentralized and end-to-end encrypted
and open to collaborators from other messaging efforts. 

### I don't have a Delta Chat account yet, how can I play with this?  {#tryout}

[Install Delta Chat](https://get.delta.chat) and in the setup-screen 
just scan this invitation code
to obtain a limited test e-mail account:

## How does xstore work? Where does it get its apps from? 

XXX describe and link xdcget and xdcstore and that xstore is a deployment of these tools
XXX turn the below into 3-4 bullet notes 

Private Apps can not access the Internet.
That's what makes them private.
So if you share the store.xdc to another chat,
it will not work there.
Only because
[xstore@testrun.org](mailto:xstore@testrun.org)
is a chat bot which gets told by the store.xdc
which app you want to download,
it can download the app from the Internet
and send it to you in the chat.

If you deleted the store or
chose "clear chat" to clean up,
you can at any point in time just send "hi"
to [xstore@testrun.org](mailto:xstore@testrun.org) again,
and it will re-send the store to the chat.

**Note:**
if your version of Delta Chat is older than 1.38,
the store.xdc will not work properly;
you can not share downloaded Private Apps to a chat then.
[Just upgrade your Delta Chat app](download)
to make it work.

**And another note:**
if you use the XMPP messenger cheogram,
xstore will not work for you yet;
but with upcoming support for webxdc in XMPP/e-mail bridges
you might be able to message [xstore@testrun.org](mailto:xstore@testrun.org)
and download apps from there.

## Do I have to use the official xstore?

Of course not.
You can always share a Private App from one chat to another;
without DRM,
without tracking,
without login/consent barriers.
Any Private App is just a .xdc file
saved as an e-mail attachment.

Additionally to that,
you can also self-host the bot
we use to offer xstore.
You can find installation instructions
[in the bot's codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/webxdc/store/#setting-up-the-bot).
It works best together with [xdcget](https://codeberg.org/webxdc/xdcget/),
a command line tool
which downloads Private Apps
from git repositories.

## How can I submit my own Private App to xstore?

So far,
we already have more than 20 Private Apps in xstore.
The number is growing fast,
because it's so easy to adjust any web app
so it works as a Private App in Delta Chat.

To get started with development,
you can learn more about webxdc apps on [webxdc.org](https://webxdc.org)
(`webxdc` is the technical term for Private Apps).
You can also take other Private Apps as an example;
in xstore you can find links to any app's source code
by clicking on "More":

![Details of the checklist app, it shows a description, date, file size, and link to source code.](../assets/blog/2023-08-xstore-more.png)

If you want to make your own Private App available,
just go on [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/webxdc/xdcget)
(a github alternative)
And open a pull request to our xdcget config file,
like [in this example](https://codeberg.org/webxdc/xdcget/pulls/50).
It's works basically like in F-Droid,
just with much less complexity.

We are looking forward to your contributions,
and hope you have fun with Private Apps in Delta Chat!
