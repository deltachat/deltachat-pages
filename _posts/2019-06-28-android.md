A new and much enhanced Android version (0.500.0) is released and available
on Google-Play and soon F-droid. It is the most feature-rich, UX-refined and robust 
version of Delta Chat to date and incorporates chinese translations now, along
with updates to 19 other localizations.  There now is a **revamped Chat
profile view** which combines gallery, document, settings and member list
in a new tab layout, apart from allowing to see "shared chats" with individual contacts.

Other major highlights are:

- **video recording**, including automatic recoding to smaller size 
- **forward/share** allows creating new chats, searching, direct share and more
- improved **notification** handling, should now behave more intuitively
- improved **ui:** touch friendly, better looking
- improved **support for older phones**
