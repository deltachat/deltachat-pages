![E2EE from now on](../assets/blog/2023-11-e2ee-activated.png)
Our rolling 1.42 Delta Chat app releases introduce 
**guaranteed end-to-end encryption,**
a major security milestone that took many hundreds of hours 
of challenging work from core Delta Chat teams, experts and collaborators.
Friends from activist circles, users and operators of security-related helplines,
as well as [TeamUSEC](https://teamusec.de) 
all helped us to streamline usability and implementation issues 
for guaranteed end-to-end encryption. 


## Autocrypt: convenient but "opportunistic" E2E security

Let us recall two frequent criticism of Delta Chat's [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org) 
end-to-end encryption and its *opportunistic* nature: 

- [MITM attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack): 
  Compromised infrastructure is arguably a stronger concern 
  for Delta Chat than Signal or Whatsapp users.
  After all, there is a not a single central 
  but many hundreds of different e-mail providers used with Delta Chat today,
  many of which are operating in surveillance oriented environments
  or are otherwise exposed to capable adversaries. 

- **Surprises because of unencrypted messages**: 
  Users can encounter an irritating lack of end-to-end encryption 
  when they send a first message or 
  if their chat partners don't consistently use Autocrypt-capable apps.
  They would send an un-encrypted message and only notice it after they sent a message. 
  In practise, this is less of a problem than many experts think 
  but it still is a valid concern.

Both issues are addressed with the currently rolling out 1.42 Delta Chat app releases
as "Guaranteed end-to-end encryption" prevents messages 
from unexpectedly dropping end-to-end encryption,
and protects against compromised servers or networks. 

## Guaranteed end-to-end encryption

Chats marked with a **green checkmark** guarantee end-to-end encryption:
You will only send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages
that can not be read or modified by hostile e-mail servers or networks.

To start a guaranteed end-to-end encrypted 1:1 chat,
you scan another user's "QR Invite code" 
which starts the automatic [SecureJoin protocol](https://securejoin.delta.chat)
resulting in a safely end-to-end encrypted chat and a green-checkmarked contact. 

If you create a group that only has green-checkmarked contacts
then this group will use guaranteed end-to-end encryption
that never degrades and can not be broken by e-mail providers or network attackers. 
Moreover, all members use guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chats with each other,
and they can add each other to more and different green checkmarked group chats. 
**Guaranteed end-to-end encryption spreads automatically and in a decentralized way.**

Read more in our [revised Encryption and Security FAQ](https://delta.chat/en/help#encryption-and-security) 
which is also contained and shipped with all Delta Chat apps,
and also discusses security-relevant topics such as OpenPGP security, 
Metadata protection and ephemeral messaging. 

Lastly, you may read a lot more technical and scientific background on our 
[new SecureJoin protocols documentation site](https://securejoin.delta.chat)
which also serves to prepare an independent security audit scheduled for 2024.
