Our rolling 1.42 Delta Chat app releases provide a major security-upgrade
as we introduce guaranteed end-to-end (E2E) encryption 
that works consistently and conveniently in all chats. 
But they also contain and other improvements like: 

- üîÑ Accept/Blocked, Archived, Pinned, Mute is synced across all your devices

- üóúÔ∏è Images are now compressed (unless you send them as files)

- üñºÔ∏è Global Gallery with your pictures, documents, media across all chats

- Bug fixes, bug fixes and bug fixes 

In the remainder of the post, 
we highlight the background of our past and present end-to-end encryption developments. 

## Autocrypt: convenient but "opportunistic" E2E security

Let us recall a frequent criticism of Delta Chat's [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org) 
end-to-end encryption, namely it's "opportunistic" nature: 

a) E-mail providers could try to meddle with 
   the communication of their users, reading or modifying their messages. 
   This is arguably a stronger concern for Delta Chat than with Signal, Whatsapp 
   or other centralized messengers 
   because Delta Chat users can choose but not neccessarily trust their e-mail provider. 

b) Users can encounter an irritating lack of end-to-end encryption 
   if someone is added to a group chat who doesn't consistently use Autocrypt. 
   They would send an un-encrypted message and only notice it after they sent a message. 

Both issues are addressed with the currently rolling out 1.42 Delta Chat app releases. 
"Guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chats" prevent both 1:1 chats and group chats 
from unexpectedly dropping end-to-end encryption,
and they provide protection against compromised servers or networks. 

## Guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chats

Guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chats are marked with a green checkmark.
If you are creating a group with green-checkmarked contacts 
then you will automatically get a green-checkmarked chat group. 

True to our UX security design goal, 
users do not need to understand key management, 
let alone the intricacies of public key cryptography.
Delta Chat 1.42 users rather scan each other's "QR Invite code" 
which sets up guaranteed 1:1 chats between individuals, 
and allows to securely join a guaranteed end-to-end encrypted group chat. 
All members of a green-checkmarked chat group 
enjoy guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chats with each other,
and can add each other to yet more such groups. 
**Guaranteed end-to-end encryption spreads automatically**
and is always based on a QR-code scan you did yourself with at least one other person.

which is also contained and shipped with all Delta Chat apps. 
While we did many physical and online user-tests
there still might be issues or bugs.
