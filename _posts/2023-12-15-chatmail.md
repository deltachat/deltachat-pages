Today, we are unvealing **open-signup chatmail services**,
a minimal and modern e-mail service 
to make onboarding with Delta Chat a breeze, with peace of mind: 

- **Convenience**: Get a chatmail address in a few seconds 

- **Privacy**: No questions asked, no name, numbers or e-mail 

- **Speed**: Message delivery in well under a second, end-to-end

Too good to be true? 

You may peek at [nine.testrun.org](https://testrun.org)
or simply scan the below QR code to get a `nine.testrun.org address`: 

<a href="DCACCOUNT:https://nine.testrun.org/cgi-bin/newemail.py">

After setting your avatar and name, 
you may message `echo@nine.testrun.org` and see an answer quite immediately. 


## Send a message to anyone if you can end-to-end encrypt 

Chatmail services don't allow to send un-encrypted messages 
to anyone outside the service. 
This makes spammers sad who would try to abuse open-signup chatmail addresses
because they first would need to setup OpenPGP encryption with all recipients. 
But Delta Chat uses [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org) 
which does not publish encryption keys anywhere.
Moreover, today's *Internet platforms do not collect OpenPGP identities*
and so can only sell or leak e-mail addresses but not the encryption setup. 
Therefore it's a massive uphill struggle and economically un-interesting 
for spammers to abuse chatmail accounts. 
Also, chatmail services incorporate many best e-mail server practises,
overall making it unlikely they get flagged as a source of spam. 

## Receiving newsletters and registering with websites 

Delta Chat apps support using multiple chatmail or e-mail addresses. 
With [nine.testrun.org](https://nine.testrun.org) you can setup
an additional address (account) to receive a newsletter or register with a website. 
If you don't need or want it anymore, simply delete it on your device. 

## Nine.testrun.org and running chatmail services yourself 

Our just published [Chatmail repository](https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail) 
contains the executable blue-print for setting up a modern e-mail service
that is optimized for use with Delta Chat.

[Nine.testrun.org](https://nine.testrun.org) is operated 
by some Delta Chat project members, on the side. 
This mirrors how we envision chatmail services to be operated: 
by a small group or individuals
who don't need to worry or spend a lot of time on the service. 
With some knowledge of DNS, SSH and a spare VPS (get the cheapest you can find),
you can setup and offer chatmail services pretty quickly. 
A friend easily recently set it up on a Rasperry Pi for his housing project. 
Chatmail servers are designed to run with minimal hardware requirements
and to be easy to tweek even from novice sysadmins or programmers. 

We welcome feedback and contributions to the 
[Chatmail repository](https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail)
and intend to do workshops and sessions at both the upcoming
37c3 Chaos Communication congress end of the year in Hamburg,
as well arounnd OFFDEM/FOSSDEM 2024 in Bruxelles.
