During June 7-17th many of our contributors and from neighboring projects will gather in the Black Forest. 
We will use outsides and insides of the oldest "free and democratic school" in Germany, the "Kapriole".
DIFF stands for "Decentralized Internet Federation Fusion". 
You may join if you wanted to get into current developments or do your own related thing on the side
and get to know, or get help from many of the currently active contributors. 

## Who is coming? What is happening at DIFF? 

There will be plenty folks from [Chatmail developments](https://chatmail.at), from Delta Chat UIs including Ubuntu Touch, chat bots, 
[Webxdc development](https://webxdc.org) as well as [Iroh](https://iroh.computer) and [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp) projects,
and some engaging with private Peer-to-Peer media file sharing, or developing [Watch2Gather](https://w2g.tv/en/). 
We are to be joined by international solidarity groups working under repressive conditions, 
an Ukrainian video and photo artist, piano and noise musicians
and a theater professional who is to help creating the "Can you arrest a protocol?" play about three anti-cryptography court cases ... 
which might see an experimental premiere during the DIFF gathering. 

## Co-working, cross-concern hacking and playing

As of May 12th there are around 30 people arranging themselves to make it,
with about a dozen to do so during the full date frame. 
On some days, some will likely use the opportunity to climb nearby hills or
do other excursions. 

The school will be generally open from early morning till evening
and everyone is free to cling together in groups, take a room and also do internal project sessions. 
We'll see to arrange for cooking food or walk over to some commercial food places. 
One some days we probably do presentation/demo evenings, to be announced publically. 
The place is exceptionally well suited to have kids around and Freiburg
ist also generally a vacationing area. 

## Wait, where is the program and the time table? 

It's not yet settled what will happen on which days and not everybody comes the full duration. 
Maybe check out our report about a [gathering in Kyiv a few years ago](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv) 
to get a more concrete idea. 
Maybe a so called [Union of Egoists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_egoists)
is not an entirely unfitting characterization of attendees' attitudes. 

## How to join and participate 

Send a direct message to our Fediverse [@delta@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@delta)
or to our [delta team email](delta@merlinux.eu) and then we'll add you to 
a group chat that uses an end-to-end encrypting webxdc realtime editor and other chat apps for co-ordination. 
You will need to care for some accomodation yourself but much else we'll see to collectively settle.
DIFF also serves as a testbed for arranging event onboarding and communications in chat groups and chat apps,
ahead, during and afterwards.
