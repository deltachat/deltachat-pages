During June 7-17th many of our contributors and from neighboring projects will gather in the Black Forest. 
We will use outsides and insides of the oldest "free and democratic school" in Germany, the "Kapriole".
DIFF currently stands for "Decentralized Internet Federation Fusion". 

## Who is coming? What is happening at DIFF? 

There will be plenty folks from [Chatmail developments](https://chatmail.at), from Delta Chat Android/iOS/Desktop/UbuntuTouch, chat bots, 
[webxdc app development](https://webxdc.org) as well as [Iroh](https://iroh.computer) and [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp) projects,
and then some who engage with reviving Peer-to-Peer file sharing, or develop [Watch2Gather](https://w2g.tv/en/). 
We are to be joined by people from international solidarity groups,
an Ukrainian video and photo artist, piano and noise musicians
and likely a theater professional who is to help creating the "Can you arrest a protocol?" play 
about three anti-cryptography court cases ... which might see an experimental premiere during DIFF. 

You are invited to join if you want to meet folks from the above projects and contexts. 
If you want to bring some friends or conspirators, be our guests. 

## Co-working, cross-concern hacking and playing

As of May 12th there are at least 30 people arranging themselves to make it,
with about a dozen to do so during the full date frame. 
On some days, some will likely use the opportunity to climb nearby hills or
do other excursions. 
Maybe a so called [Union of Egoists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_egoists)
is not an entirely unfitting reference of how our gatherings play out. 

The school will be generally open from early morning till evening
and everyone may also cling together in small groups, take a room and also do internal project sessions. 
We'll see to arrange for cooking food if not walking over to some commercial food places. 
On some days we probably do presentation/demo evenings, and announce them publically. 
The place is also exceptionally well suited to have kids around and Freiburg,
at the left bottom in germany, ist also generally a vacationing area. 
Please take note of our [Community standards](https://delta.chat/en/community-standards). 

It's not yet settled what will happen on which days, and not everybody comes the full 10 day duration. 
It may help to read an older report of a pre-decessor [gathering in Kyiv a few years ago](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv) 
to get a more concrete idea. 

## Attending and joining DIFF

If you, also along with a group of like-minded people, want to join DIFF, that's quite possible still! 
If you are an individual interested in any of the above, we'll see to help you feel at home. 
Send a direct message to our Fediverse [@delta@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@delta)
or to our [delta team email](mailto:delta@merlinux.eu) [delta invite link](https://i.delta.chat/#56136E70473FB9E59331D760C007984652839B20&a=delta%40merlinux.eu&n=Delta%20Chat%20team&i=ZVfPYn6j2fvtpc_0M6V45uEP&s=WWjjkBKJJ3So8AfuHGXNjcyE) 
and then we'll add you to a group chat that uses an webxdc editor and other chat apps for further co-ordination. 
You will need to care for some accomodation yourself but much else we'll see to collectively settle.
There also are some possibilities for sharing a room or space if you bring some sleeping gear. 
DIFF also serves as a testbed for arranging event onboarding and communications in chat groups and chat apps,
ahead, during and after the gathering.
