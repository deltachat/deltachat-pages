After the "Delta-X" Event in Freiburg this summer, 
there is now "Decentralization Unchained" -
**one day of talks, workshops, discussions, hacking**
around the topics of decentralizing infrastructures in common, 
and, of course, Delta.Chat especially.

"Decentralization Unchained" happens in Kyiv, November 3, 2018.

For the whole program and further information,
also about how you can contribute,
there is a separate website about this event at

Looking forward to see you :)
