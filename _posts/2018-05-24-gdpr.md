GDPR? It's time to relax with Delta.chat :) 

The privacy story of Delta.chat and the GDPR is a relatively simple one.
Delta Chat was always driven by "privacy by design" considerations. 
Here are two recently published, more worked out privacy statements:

- a [GDPR compliance summary page for the
  Delta/Android app](https://delta.chat/en/gdpr). 
  TLDR: delta.chat has **privacy by design**: no Delta 
  servers, no address book upload, by-default e2e encryption.

- a [privacy statement for the delta.chat
  website (only german so far)](https://delta.chat/de/gdpr). 
  TLDR: no cookies, no tracking, participation in e-mail mailing 
  lists only on an explicit subscription request. 

If you have any questions or comments please file issues on github 
or send mail to the e-mail address listed in the website privacy statement.
