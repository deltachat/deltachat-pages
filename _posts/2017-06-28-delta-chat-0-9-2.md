title: Delta Chat v0.9.2 feat. Autocrypt Level 1
---

This version implements new **Autocrypt** encryption standard that was settled in Freiburg on the Hackathon in early June 2017. 
Delta Chat is proud being a part of this.

For the user nothing has changed: If two Delta Chat devices are used, the end-to-end-encryption using the OpenPGP standard is enabled **automatically**.
No need to worry about keys, certificates, revocation, trust and so on.

But there are even more good news: As soon as Autocrypt is availabe in **other mail apps** - eg. Thunderbird or K-9 - the automatic encryption is also possible between Delta Chat and these apps :-)

The full list of all changes:

* Encrypt group chats
* Cryptographically sign messages
* Validate signatures of incoming messages ("Info" shows the state)
* Show a little lock beside end-to-end-encrypted messages with a validated signature
* If end-to-end-encryption is available on sending time, guarantee the message not to be sent without end-to-end-encryption later
* Show special characters in HTML-mails
* Help MUAs on showing chat threads
* Show attachments from multipart/alternative structures
* Upgrade from Autocrypt Level 0 to Level 1; as the levels are not compatible, encryption on mixed setups does not happen
* Update Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and French translations


As usual, the update will be available on F-Droid the next days.
