No need to blush or melt in agony after sending a message anymore!
Editing and deleting messages is now available in most app stores :) 

How is this possible you might wonder?  
If you are not interested just skip to the new feature descriptions below. 
Otherwise here are the two reasons 
why Delta Chat can do instant messenger things like WhatsApp,
while using the e-mail system:

1. **Delta Chat is not a classic e-mail client.**
   It doesn't show you the content of a mailbox (IMAP) folder. 
   Delta only fetches new messages but never looks back at them. 
   The e-mail server functions not as a message store but as a message transport. 
   Chatmail servers in particular are less like GMail and more like Signal 
   in that they constantly remove messages after they were received. 

2. **Delta Chat uses special messages to co-ordinate encryption, metadata and group interactions.**
   Examples for special messages are secure encryption setup, reactions, 
   group creation or membership changes, multi-device synchronization messages
   and indeed now editing or deleting a chat message. 
   Unlike Signal, there is no server state, no server-side group metadata,
   also not in encrypted form. 
   Rather, **Delta Chat implements a Peer-to-Peer messaging paradigm**, 
   using e-mail servers as transport, and not for storage. 

With those fundamentals out of the way, let's highlight the new features
and maybe start with "saving" messages before editing or deleting them ;) 


## Empowering "Saved Messages" memory

When you forward a message to the "Saved Messages" chat
the message will preserve a ">" link jump to the original message.
Messages you saved will have a small bookmark icon in the chat 
so you can easily recognize that you already saved them.

There also is a new action when you select a message 
to easily save or bookmark it so that it appears in "Saved Messages". 
The best: it all is properly synchronized between your devices. 

## Typo-fixing galore: Editing Messages

When you select a message, you can now pick the stencil ("edit" action)
and will be back as if the message were a draft. 
Note that you can only edit the text but you can not change any attachments. 
Once you send the message, all your chat partners will see an "edited" message,
also indicated the message bubble. 

## Deleting messages across devices

In the past, every time you deleted a chat or a message from one device 
you would need to go to all your other devices and repeat the process over and over.
Now message and chat deletion is synchronized across all your devices without breaking a sweat.

If you posted something accidentally (passwords, wrong files or pictures etc.) 
you can also delete your own messages for everyone in the chat now. 

## Limits of rewriting the past? 

Neither deletion or editing currently have particular restrictions,
and there is no history of message edits. 
You can retract your own message from a year ago,
and edit a message 10 times. 
Will this happen in any annoying scale? 
If so, we'll see to address it and iterate. 
But note that antagonistic chat partners have also many other ways 
to trick and annoy, and it may be a good idea to avoid them generally.
Meanwhile, enjoy your new typo-fixing, organizing and retracting powers!
