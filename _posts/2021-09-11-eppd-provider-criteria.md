What provider should I use for Delta Chat?  We hear this question often but it's not so easy to answer. But it's not so easy to answer. Everyone has different needs. So how to go about this? 

## Finding Criteria for e-mail comparisons

Early this year we applied for EU funding to come up with a thorough e-mail provider comparison approach and to improve our apps while doing that. In April we received funding from the [DAPSI EU consortium](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/eppd/) to support a more comprehensive approach of comparing e-mail providers. To find out about useful comparison criteria, we systematically asked Delta Chat power users from ten countries, about what they need from a provider - including what their communities like or dislike about different providers. We just finished a report on these interviews and the criteria which we now use for comparing e-mail providers in the next couple of months.

You'll also see the EPPD comparison criteria below which we'll use to evaluate roughly 20 providers in the upcoming months. Many thanks also to [Gerry](https://github.com/gerryfrancis) who majorly helped with identifying the providers and collecting initial information about them. Apart from making it easier for Delta Chat users to choose a provider, we are to use these findings to make Delta Chat easier to use. In fact, the recent [Connectivity and Quota improvements](https://delta.chat/en/2021-08-24-updates#connectivity-and-quota) already originate in our EPPD effort. 

If you have any additional input or questions on this please mention "EPPD" in a post on our [support forum](https://support.delta.chat) -- you can login with your Delta Chat app there through a QR scan btw :) 


## Performance criteria (mostly measured through scripts) 

1. How much delay is between sending and receiving a message through various providers? 
2. Does a provider systematically block e-mails from other (smaller or larger) providers? 
3. How many recipients per message are allowed  (limits group size)?
4. How many messages per hour are accepted until a rate limit is reached and messages are rejected?
5. What is the max. attachment size for a message?
6. Does the provider send quota warnings and efficient means for removing messages from server?
7. Does the provider support SMTP and IMAP and has a valid TLS?
8. Does the provider support IDLE /MOVE/ IMAP and quota extension?
9. Does the provider support alias and/ or plus extension?

## Qualitative criteria (human research) 

10. Does the provider have open registration or is it invite only?
11. What are the costs and what kind of business model is applied?
12. How many people manage the provider? (risk of overload for smaller providers?)
13. What is the mailbox storage size?
14. Grey-listing: does the provider delay initial messages from unknown senders? 
15. Is there published information about rate limits?
16. Privacy Policy: Which personal data is required for account creation?
17. Privacy Policy: What data is used for third parties, advertisers?
18. Migration: Can I set a forwarding alias address?
19. Migration: Can all data, including contacts and messages (folders) be exported and imported from one provider to another?
