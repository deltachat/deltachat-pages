During June 7-17th many of our contributors and from neighboring projects will gather in Freiburg in the Black Forest.
We will use outsides and insides of the oldest "free and democratic school" in Germany, the "Kapriole".
DIFF currently stands for "Decentralized Internet Federation Fusion". 

## Who is coming? What is happening at DIFF? 

There will be plenty folks from [chatmail developments](https://chatmail.at), from Delta Chat Android/iOS/Desktop/UbuntuTouch, chat bots, 
[webxdc app development](https://webxdc.org) as well as [Iroh](https://iroh.computer) and [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp) projects,
and then some who engage with reviving Peer-to-Peer file sharing, or develop [Watch2Gether](https://w2g.tv/en/). 
We are to be joined by people from international solidarity groups,
an Ukrainian video and photo artist, piano and noise musicians
and likely a theater professional who is to help creating the "Can you arrest a protocol?" play 
about three anti-cryptography court cases ... which might see an experimental premiere during DIFF. 

You are invited to join any of this. 
If you want to bring some friends or conspirators, be our guests. 

## Co-working, cross-concern hacking and diversions 

As of May 12th there are 30+ people arranging themselves to make it,
with about a dozen to do so during the full date frame. 
On some days, some will likely use the opportunity to climb nearby hills, jump into rivers or lakes,
or engage in other diversions. 
Maybe a so called [Union of Egoists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_egoists)
is not an entirely unfitting reference of how our gatherings typically play out. 
You may also get some vibes by reading a report about a [gathering in Kyiv a few years ago](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv). 

The school will be generally open from morning till evening
and everyone may also cling together in small groups, take a room and also do internal project sessions. 
We'll see to arrange for some food and drinks. Commercial food places are in walking distance. 
On some days we probably do presentation/demo evenings, and announce them publically. 
The place is also exceptionally well suited to have kids around and Freiburg
is also generally a vacationing area, with quick train rides to Switzerland and France. 

## Attending and joining DIFF

If you, maybe along with a group of like-minded people, want to join DIFF, that's quite possible still! 
If you are an individual interested in any of the above, we'll see to help you feel at home and welcome. 
Please take note of our [Community standards](https://delta.chat/en/community-standards). 

Please send a direct message to our Fediverse [@delta@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@delta)
or to our [delta team address](mailto:delta@merlinux.eu) ([invite link](https://i.delta.chat/#56136E70473FB9E59331D760C007984652839B20&a=delta%40merlinux.eu&n=Delta%20Chat%20team&i=ZVfPYn6j2fvtpc_0M6V45uEP&s=WWjjkBKJJ3So8AfuHGXNjcyE))
and from there we'll add you to a group chat that uses an webxdc editor and other chat apps for further co-ordination. 
You will need to care for some accommodation yourself. 
There also are some possibilities for sharing a room or space if you bring some sleeping gear. 
DIFF also serves as a testbed for arranging event onboarding and communications in chat groups and chat apps,
ahead, during and after the gathering.
