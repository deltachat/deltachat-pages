title: "Delta Chat Version 2 seamlessly transitions to a more robust end-to-end security model"

Version 2 of Delta Chat upgrades end-to-end encrypted chats to become always end-to-end encrypted,
mirroring the fact that the growing [chatmail relay network](https://chatmail.at/relay) 
strictly enforces end-to-end encryption with metadata-minimization for all travelling messages. 
This major security upgrade is automatic and maintains general compatibility with older app releases. 
We much prefer to avoid asking users or developers for co-ordinated upgrades. 

A while ago, a contributor's mom who had used Delta Chat for years 
got back to us saying "Everything is fine! But why does each message have a hand bag?". 
She refered to the lock icon decorating each end-to-end encrypted message. 
Version 2 releases are for her and many others who don't engage in theorizing end-to-end encryption
yet want to be sure they are using a messenger that keeps their chats, messages and contacts private.


## Pervasive end-to-end security for all messages by default

Experienced developers know: 
the best code or UI in any sufficiently complex system is precisely that which can be removed 
while simultanously improving overall functionality for users. 
A [massive rework in the central chatmail core Rust library](https://github.com/chatmail/core/pull/6796) 
added 4969 and removed 6299 lines of code, netting to removal of 1330 LOCs overall. 
In turn, it allowed Delta Chat apps on all platforms 
to remove pad locks, green checkmarks (mostly) and "encryption broken" dialogues from chats,
providing a robust consistently end-to-end encrypted user experience, by default.

## Classic e-mail usage is also enhanced but requires manual opt-in

While it's impossible 
to receive or send messages without end-to-end encryption
when automatically onboarding with [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays)
you can manually setup classic e-mail accounts 
that support transporting messages without end-to-end encryption. 
A "mail icon" will mark each such messages and also the chat's avatar. 
Morewover, with classic e-mail profiles you can use the "new email" UI action 
that allows to set a subject and add e-mail address recipients
before sending a cleartext e-mail message. 

## Contact Profiles are more beautiful on all platforms
