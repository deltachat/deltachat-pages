There are new Desktop releases (0.104.0) with a new Rust-based encryption engine (RPGP),
better Mac and Linux release packaging and several other UX improvements which 
we detail further below.  See "Assets" on our [github releases page](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop/releases/tag/v0.104.0) for the respective downloads. 

**Important Notes about this release**:

- **Don't forget to Synchronize Android/iOS to Desktop:** if you install Delta Chat desktop next
  to an already existing mobile version you need to synchronize your setups. 
  After configuring Delta Chat Desktop, on Android trigger the "Send Autocrypt Setup message" in 
  advanced settings and accept the Setup message from your Desktop app. After correctly entering 
  the security/confirmation number (presented om mobile, typed in on desktop) you will see 
  outgoing and incoming messages on both devices -- synchronization should be quite immediate. 

- **You can use Desktop as your only Delta Chat App, no mobile required.**

- **Delta Chat Desktop is well usable but does not have all UX features
  of Android**. You are more than welcome to contribute [fixes/features on github](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop) but note that feature discussion usually happens first 
  on the [support forum](https://support.delta.chat). To begin with, the onboarding
  process for existing Android/iOS Delta Chat users could be nicer ;) 


Here are the most major technical/UX highlights of the 0.104.0 Desktop Release: 

- We now use [RPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp), the first
  full-Rust implementation of OpenPGP, the underlying encryption format 
  that Delta Chat is using. This new Rust library supports [Autocrypt 1.1](https://autocrypt.org) 
  primitives and will allow to switch to ED25519 keys for e-mail encryption
  within the two next releases. The Desktop releases are the first 
  tangible sign of the upcoming [Rustocalypse](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv#the-coming-delta-chat-rustocalypse). Many thanks to Friedel for his perseverance on RPGP and
  all the support with integrations!

- We integrated support for the Desktop side of [location
  streaming](https://delta.chat/en/2019-05-08-xyiv#on-demand-location-streaming).
  Desktop can show a map for a group and the last position(s) of its participants
  if they enable location streaming. Android devices can report location via "attach location" 
  after you enabled "on-demand-location streaming" in the experimental feature section of the settings. 
  You can set points of interest for a group and use the time range of historic 
  data to look at. Many thanks to Nico who pushed this feature majorly forward 
  in the last weeks so that we could use it [in the game](https://deploy-preview-162--deltachat.netlify.com/en/2019-05-08-xyiv#gaming-with-decentralization).

- Lots of [improved Desktop packaging](download),
  majorly pushed forward by Jikstra the last weeks: 
  There are now **signed releases for Mac**
  which allows to install Delta Chat Desktop without fiddling with security settings. 
  Also openssl and all other dependencies are included in the dmg
  install file. This means no more `brew install ...` for mac users!

  There are now **.deb archives for all major Ubuntu versions**
  They each pull in all needed dependencies for the particular Ubuntu versions, 
  so you don't need to manually install dependencies.

  Good news for ArchLinux users too: the **updated deltachat-desktop-git AUR 
  package now uses RPGP too**.

Besides, many smaller features and fixes landed with this Desktop release: 

- draft new messages are now saved on a per-chat basis

- some performance fixes which make the UI more fluid (more are coming!) 

- importing and exporting keys works again 

- a lot of refactoring of the backend/state handling took place,
  to simplify future changes and maintenance. 

- the desktop release now has support for simple markdown. Give it a try!
