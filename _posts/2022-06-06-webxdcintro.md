title: webxdc: web apps shared in a chat (DRAFT)

Delta Chat 1.30 apps just introduced support on all platforms for [webxdc apps](https://webxdc.org). 
Webxdc apps provide a new way to mix and multiply web-interactive content with chat messaging. 
You attach or share a ".xdc" file containing a HTML5 app to a chat 
and anyone there can seemlessly start to interact and collaborate through it ... 
no Logins or passwords or mobile verifications required.

.. hello video ... 

## Using webxdc apps is safe and easy 

One started, a webxdc app can send and receive data with anyone else in the chat who started the same webxdc app. Each webxdc app runs in a locked-down browser sandbox where there is no technical possibility to interact with any servers or entities outside the chat. This is why ".xdc" files need to be self-contained zip-files and bring all needed resources. Delta Chat apps route application update data between chat pers using end-to-end encryption. Even better, neither Delta Chat nor webxdc app developers have or can gain any access to user-generated data, not even in encrypted form. 

## Implementing your own HTML5 apps

Webxdc apps are simpler to implement than traditional web apps because all authentication and end-to-endcrypted networking is already done. 

Webxdc could be used by other chat messengers and likely will be. After all, webxdc apps could be compatible across chat messengers! However, many of those are currently busy with introducing advertising or blockchains or returning profit for venture capital investments 
so we are not holding our breath right now.
Rest assured, when the time comes and interest rises 
we'll be there and open to collaboration :)
