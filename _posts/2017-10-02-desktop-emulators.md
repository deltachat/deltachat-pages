title: Delta Chat on Desktop

Currently the focus in development is the android version with all the features that other chats will offer.
So the implementation of a native desktop client is postponed (or a task for everyone who would like to [help](support)).

Although Delta Chat is in fact yet another email client some of you would like to run it on the desktop ..

.. And you can do !
**You can use Delta Chat on Desktops using emulators.**

Ubuntu linux users can be happy. It requires just two commands in the terminal and the original Delta Chat APK is running in ANBOX. ... **And it is running fine !**
You will find the instructions on [https://Anbox.io](https://anbox.io#get-started)

The good news is that Anbox is open source too and not a data collector by itself.
The bad news is that Anbox is currently alpha state and currently only availalbe for distris which supports the *snap* packages.
Nevertheless - I run it several days without any damage 

For Windows there are several emulators like Nox player, ANDY or Bluestack which are NOT open source and they request your data for the bill - you should have it mind when you decide whether it is really such a benefit to run Delta Chat directly instead of the regular email client.
