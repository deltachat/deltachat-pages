Last days saw drastic uptake of Delta Chat app usage especially in the US and Cuba. 
We can only guess about the dynamics behind this surge. 
Delta Chat is increasingly advertised by 3rd parties as a resilient and reliable decentralized messenger, 
and as offering a pleasing and capable user interface that many families and small groups appreciate. 

## ~5000 new users per hour with default chatmail relay

After a few adjustments the small physical server is still humming along at 20% CPU and IO pressure. 

## 1.8 Million delivered Google/Apple push notifications

Our small ephemeral privacy-preserving Push notification proxy is at 3% CPU usage. 

## Google Play Android downloads crossed 500K downloads

## Scaling the interoperable chatmail relay network 

There are about 30 [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays) on all continents 
each operated by different individuals, groups or companies. 
Most new users use the default onboarding server,
reproducing the known problem of "formally decentralized but centralized in practise" (Mastodon, Matrix, SimpleX ...). 

We are engaging in two development areas to fundamentally neutralize this centralization tendency 
and improve resiliency and reliability of service in an increasingly fragmented Internet: 

- "Zero-metadata": Hardening Delta Chat's end-to-end encryption
  properties, including sealed-sender and other activities 

- "Multi-transport": Allowing a chat profile to use multiple chatmail relays *interchangeably and automatically*

Both these somewhat complex development areas will see more detailed discussion and work towards releases 
at the upcoming [DIFF gathering in the black forest starting June 7th](https://delta.chat/en/2025-05-12-diff-invitation). 


## We'd like to become fully funded by donations to remain independent 

All parts of our projects, the UIs and apps, the chatmail core Rust library or the chatmail relay templates
are freely used by others. 
There are no hidden proprietary parts. 
We also have no debt to any Venture Capital investors and we'd like to keep it this way. 

Please consider donating if you want our efforts to continue.
