Last days saw dramatic uptake of Delta Chat app usage especially in the US and Cuba. 
We can only guess about the dynamics behind this surge. 
Delta Chat is increasingly advertised by 3rd parties as a resilient and reliable decentralized messenger, 
and as offering a pleasing and capable user interface that many families and small groups appreciate. 
We have no marketing department to speak off. 

## ~5000 new users per hour with default chatmail relay

After a few adjustments the small physical server is still humming along at 20% CPU and IO pressure. 

## 1.8 Million Google/Apple push notifications per day

This number reflects the number of incoming messages for users who installed from Google Play or Apple store. 
F-droid, Desktop or classic e-mail users are all not reflected in this number. 

## Google Play Android downloads crossed 500K downloads

There was a big ~80K download increase the last day. 

## Scaling the interoperable chatmail relay network 

While there are about 30 [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays) on all continents 
most new users use the default onboarding server,
reproducing the known problem of "formally decentralized but centralized in practise" offerings. 

We are engaging in two development areas to fundamentally neutralize this centralization tendency 
and improve resiliency and reliability of service in an increasingly fragmented Internet: 

- "Zero-metadata": Hardening Delta Chat's end-to-end encryption
  properties, including sealed-sender and other activities 

- "Multi-transport": Allowing a chat profile to use multiple chatmail relays *interchangeably and automatically*

These developments take place within the [chatmail core infrastructure project](https://chatmail.at)
which provides the basis for many [chatmail client apps and bots](https://chatmail.at/clients)
also from many 3rd parties. 

## From public funding to donation based funding 

Public funding dried up in 2025. 

We have no debt to any Venture Capital investors. 

We'd like to keep it this way.
