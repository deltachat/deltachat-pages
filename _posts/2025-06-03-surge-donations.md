Last days saw a dramatic uptake of Delta Chat usage especially in the US and Cuba. 
We can only guess about the dynamics behind this surge. 
Delta Chat is increasingly advertised by 3rd parties as a resilient and reliable decentralized messenger, 
and as offering a pleasing and capable user interface that many families, groups and communities appreciate. 
Be that as it may, let's look at some indicators behind the user surge. 

## 5000 new users per hour on the default chatmail relay

After a few adjustments the small physical server is humming along at 20% CPU and IO pressure. 

## 1.8 Million Google/Apple push notifications per day

This number reflects the number of incoming messages for users who installed from Google Play or Apple store. 
F-droid, Desktop or classic e-mail users are all not reflected in this number. 

## Google Play Android downloads crossed 500K downloads

There was a big ~80K download increase the last day. 


## Funding for a globally scaled chatmail relay network

While there are about 30 community-operated [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays) on all continents 
most new users choose the default onboarding server,
reproducing the known problem of "formally decentralized but centralized in practise" offerings. 
We are engaging in two key R&D areas to fundamentally neutralize this centralization tendency 
and achieve unprecedented resiliency, distributed scale and privacy:

- **Zero-metadata**: Hardening Delta Chat's end-to-end encryption properties, providing sealed-sender 

- **Multi-transport**: Allowing a chat profile to use multiple chatmail relays *interchangeably and automatically*

These infrastructure developments take place within the [chatmail development community](https://chatmail.at)
which provides the infrastructural basis for [all chatmail client apps and bots](https://chatmail.at/clients).

However, public funding suddenly dried up earlier in 2025,
disrupting our ability to sustain our efforts and stay focused on challenging goals. 

We have no debt to any Venture Capital investors. 
We'd like to keep it this way.
