Last days saw a noticeable uptake of Delta Chat users especially in the US and Cuba. 
We can only guess about the dynamics behind this surge. 
Delta Chat is increasingly advertised by 3rd parties as a resilient and reliable decentralized messenger, 
and as offering a pleasing and capable user interface that many families, groups and communities appreciate. 
Especially if they are dispersed across state borders and suffer outages. 

## 5000 new users per hour on the default chatmail relay

After a few adjustments the small physical server is humming along at 20% CPU and IO pressure. 

## 1.8 Million Google/Apple push notifications per day

This number reflects the number of incoming messages for users who installed from Google Play or Apple store. 
F-droid, Desktop or classic e-mail users are all not reflected in this number. 

## Google Play Android downloads crossed 500K downloads

There was a big ~80K download increase the last day. 

## Funding for a globally scalable chatmail relay network

While there are about 30 community-operated [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays) on all continents 
most new users choose the default onboarding server,
reproducing the known problem of "formally decentralized but centralized in practise" offerings. 
We are engaging in two key Research and Development areas to fundamentally neutralize this centralization tendency 
and achieve unprecedented resiliency, reliability and privacy:

- **Zero-metadata**: Hardening Delta Chat's end-to-end encryption properties, including sealed-sender 

- **Multi-transport**: Allowing a chat profile to use multiple chatmail relays *interchangeably and automatically*

These infrastructure developments take place within the [chatmail development community](https://chatmail.at)
which provides the infrastructural basis for [all chatmail client apps and bots](https://chatmail.at/clients)
from many 3rd parties. 

However, public funding dried up earlier in 2025. 

On the plus side, we have no debt to any Venture Capital investors. 

We'd like to keep it this way.
