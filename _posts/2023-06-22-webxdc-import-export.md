TODO: main: new Import/Export API, link to specs: https://docs.webxdc.org/spec.html#sendtochat

## Special thanks to NLNET and their Next-Generation-Internet work

TODO: thanks to [NLNET foundation](https://nlnet.nl/), in turn funded by the European Commission. We particularly like to thank Michiel, Jos and the rest of the NLNET NGI team for smooth handling of advising, reporting and financing.

## Calendar app

TODO: mention Calendar app as example use case (mention that notifications of events is not currently possible, would need new API to be added in the future?)

TODO: maybe also mention the Draw app

## WebXDC adoption

TODO: mention [Cheogram](https://cheogram.com/) and [Monocles Chat](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.monocles.chat/) as other implementations of WebXDC interpreters.
