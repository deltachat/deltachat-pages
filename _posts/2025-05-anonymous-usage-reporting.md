We would like to improve Delta Chat with your help.
This is why the newest version of Delta Chat for Android asks whether you want
to send us anonymous usage statistics.

You can enable this with the following steps: 

**"Settings -> Advanced → Send statistics to Delta Chat’s developers"**

When you turn it on, a file with statistics will be sent to a bot once a week.
If you're curious, you can open that chat and inspect what was sent.
Everything is fully transparent;
you can see exactly which data was sent, and when.


## How will this data be used?

We are interested in numbers like:

- How many contacts are introduced by personally scanning a QR code
- Which versions of Delta Chat are being used
- How many messages are unencrypted

We're taking care to collect the least amount of data possible.
Most importantly, no personally identifiable information is shared,
only statistics about your usage of Delta Chat
and whether Delta Chat is properly working.


## Why this matters

By enabling this setting, you’re helping us identify
real-world usability, security,
and [usable security](https://cispa.de/en/research/empiricial-and-behavioral-security/usable-security) issues.
This allows us to prioritize improvements that actually matter to you and other users.
If you have any questions, feel free to email us at delta@merlinux.eu or ask our forum.

Thanks again for supporting Delta Chat!
