**TL;DR: In the newest release of Delta Chat (1.XXX),
you can help improve Delta Chat by enabling
"Advanced → Send statistics to Delta Chat’s developers"
in the settings!
This gives us real-world usage data
which we're currently lacking.**

_Are our users using secure QR codes to get into contact?_<br/>
_Do many chats have [guaranteed end-to-end encryption](https://delta.chat/en/2023-11-23-jumbo-42)?_<br/>
_Are many messages failing to decrypt, or is this a rare edge case?_<br/>

Short of anecdotal reports from the community, we have no idea!
This lack of feedback makes it hard to focus our development efforts
where they’re most needed.

In order to change this,
we are introducing a "send statistics" function
as an opt-in mechanism to help us collect real-world data.

You can enable it at:

**Settings → Advanced → Send statistics to Delta Chat's developers**

# What statistics are collected?

We are interested in numbers like:

- How many of your contacts have a green checkmark, and how many of these were introduced by personally scanning a QR code, rather than introduced by someone else?
- How many of your messages are sent to contacts with a green checkmark?
- Whether features like disappearing messages are used

The full list of statistics we want to collect at first is here: XXX

No personally identifiable information is sent,
only statistics about your usage of Delta Chat
and whether Delta Chat is working fine.

# How is the data sent?

Once enabled,
the app sends the data once a week to a bot via a muted and archived chat.
If you're curious, you can open that chat and inspect exactly what was sent.

# Why this matters

By enabling this setting, you’re helping us identify
real-world usability, security, and [usable security](https://cispa.de/en/research/empiricial-and-behavioral-security/usable-security) issues —
and prioritize improvements that actually matter to you and other users.

Thanks for supporting Delta Chat!
