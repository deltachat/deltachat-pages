**TL;DR: In the newest release of Delta Chat (1.XXX),
please help us improve Delta Chat
by enabling "Advanced -> Send statistics to Delta Chat's developers"
in the settings!**

The best cryptography algorithm doesn't help
if the user interface is too confusing
so that the user uses the app in an insecure way.
This is why we are trying to improve the [Usable Security](https://cispa.de/en/research/empiricial-and-behavioral-security/usable-security)
of Delta Chat.

For the beginning, we are interested
in how many of your chats are "verified" and how many are not,
and related information.
The full list of statistics we want to collect is here: XXX

So, if you want to help us 
to improve the usable security of Delta Chat,
go to the settings
and enable "Advanced -> Send statistics to Delta Chat's developers".

The data will be sent once a week to a bot that collects them.
The chat with the bot will be muted and archived in order not to disturb you,
but if you are interested,
you can look at the messages
to see which information they contain.

Thank you!
