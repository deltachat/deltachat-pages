**New Delta chat releases! Thanks to all the early testers and all the work
that went into the new releases on Android, iOS and Desktop. Here is an
overview of what to expect:**

## Desktop 1.3

- Scan QR codes on desktop to verify chats or join groups
- Pin chats to the top if you need them often
- Change the names of your contacts to tell them apart
- For new accounts, ed25519 keys are generated. The new keys are smaller and faster. [This saves traffic](https://delta.chat/en/2020-03-11-reduced-message-size) and time.
