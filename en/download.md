## ❸ Enter a Username and Meet Your Friends

Now you can enter a username,
select a profile picture,
and chat with your friends.
**NOTE:** with a [@nine.testrun.org](https://nine.testrun.org/info.html) account
you can't send unencrypted messages
to users on other servers;
meet them and verify them by [scanning QR codes](help#howtoe2ee)
or ask them to send a message to you first.
