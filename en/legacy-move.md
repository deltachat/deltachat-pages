## Upcoming Change: March 2026

In **March 2026**, the option **"Move automatically to DeltaChat Folder"** will be removed.
If you are not using other email apps to read your normal inbox, this change will likely not affect you.

Otherwise, encrypted chat messages may appear in your other email apps.
To prevent this, we recommend using two separate profiles within Delta Chat:
1.  **A Dedicated Chat Profile**: For seamless chatting with your existing contacts.
2.  **A Classic Email Profile (Optional)**: To read your normal inbox and communicate with non-chat contacts.

With this setup, none of your contacts need to change anything.
Your encrypted chat contacts will simply continue chatting, and you can still read and reply to emails from Delta Chat.
Here are the two steps we recommend to take.

### Step 1: Move towards Dedicated Chat Profile

1.  **Add a relay**: Go to **Settings → Advanced → Relays** and tap **Add Relay**.

2.  **Scan a new QR code**: Visit <https://chatmail.at/relays>, select any relay, and scan its QR code.

3.  **Set as default**: Tap the new relay and select **Default**.

Your contacts will automatically learn your new dedicated address when they see your messages, reactions, or read receipts.

### Step 2: Keep using Delta Chat for your classic email (Optional)

To continue receiving normal emails on your old address:

- **Mobile**: Tap your avatar and select **Add Profile**.

- **Desktop**: Click the **"+"** button in the sidebar.

Continue with **Create Profile** → **Use other server** → **Use classic email as relay**
and enter your email address and password.
After successful configuration, you will receive email messages again
and can send replies to your email contacts just like today.


### Step 3: Remove the old shared address from your dedicated chat profile

After your contacts have learned about your new dedicated chat address,
you can remove the old shared address from the "relay" list in the **Advanced Settings**.


## Test the Change Today

You can see the effect of the upcoming removal now:

1.  Go to **Settings → Advanced**.
2.  Disable **"Move automatically to DeltaChat Folder"**.

If encrypted messages start appearing in your other email apps, follow the split recommendation above.


## Background: Shared vs. Dedicated Addresses

Sharing one email address between Delta Chat and classic email apps causes several issues:

- **Notifications**: You might get double notifications or none at all.

- **Clutter**: Encrypted chat messages can clutter your classic email inbox.

- **Complexity**: It hinders the development of major features like multi-server support.

We recognize that several people who started using Delta Chat in 2024 
or earlier appreciated using a single mailbox for "everything."
The hundred thousand(s) of new Delta Chat users in 2025 and 2026 
rarely know that they are using email addresses. 
Instead of continuing to invest developer hours into what is now an edge case, 
we are focusing on providing a seamless, reliable, and secure experience 
while addressing the many feature requests we receive (on average 30 requests per month).
