## Detailed data protection information

### 1. Name and contact information of the data controller

Responsible for the processing of your personal data is 
```
    merlinux GmbH
    Represented by the managing director Holger Krekel
    Reichsgrafen Str. 20
    79102 Freiburg
    Germany
```
E-mail: [delta-privacy@merlinux.eu](mailto:delta-privacy@merlinux.eu)

Our data protection officer: **Prof. Dr. Fabian Schmieder**, lexICT UG (limited), Ostfeldstr. 49, 30559 Hannover. You can contact him at [info@lexict.de](mailto:info@lexict.de) Keyword: DeltaChat.

### 2. Processing when using the Delta chat e-mail messenger

All data is stored locally on your device or with your e-mail provider. Neither we nor Delta Chat developers have any possibility to access the end user's data, as all communication and data processing takes place on the end user's device without Delta Chat servers being involved. Only for the optional Push Notification (see 2.2) the Push Notification Token is processed by Delta Chat servers without them having any knowledge about the messages themselves, not even in encrypted form.

#### 2.1 Sign up with your e-mail provider

Delta Chat communication works through your e-mail account. In order to establish the connection, the app needs the access data. These are only stored locally on your end device:

- e-mail address
- your password

The legal basis for the processing is [Art.6 (1) lit.b GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/), as you have a usage contract with us by using our services. 

Security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality of the data:
Only the bare data needed to fulfil the user request of login are stored,
encryption takes place as well as local sandboxing,
see 2.3 for further details.

#### 2.2 Heartbeat push notification

Push notifications can be sent to the user's phone at regular intervals to enable receipt of messages while the Delta Chat app is not currently active. Current messages can then be retrieved on the end device. The token is only created if the user wants reliable receipt of messages even when the app is not active. 

In order to use push notifications, a unique identifier or token (Push Notification Token) is created after the app is downloaded and installed. This token allows Delta Chat servers to send notifications to the user's device. The token is generated and provided by the provider. The token is then stored on our systems and sent to the device at regular intervals to cause the app to retrieve new messages from the e-mail provider. Our systems have no knowledge of whether a message arrives or who may have sent a message.

- Push Notification Provider for iOS systems are the Apple Services. If push notifications are enabled, the Apple Push Notification Service (iOS version) is used to provide this feature. For more information, please visit [https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/deployment-reference-ios/ior9d28751c0/web](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/deployment-reference-ios/ior9d28751c0/web). You can find the privacy policy under [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).  

The aforementioned data will only be processed with your consent, in accordance with [Art.6 (1) lit.a GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/).

#### 2.3 Data in the app

The Delta Chat app works in a data-saving way. All relevant data is stored exclusively on the respective end devices:

```
- chat histories (text messages, voice messages, media, ...).
- contacts
- settings 
```
Delta Chat servers have no access to this data, not even in encrypted form, as data processing takes place only on the end devices.

#### 2.4 App permissions

Within the app, you can enter, manage, and edit various information, tasks, and activities. The app also requires the following permissions:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Permission</th>
            <th>Reason</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Internet access</td>
            <td>This is needed to send the messages to the communication partner. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Camera access</td>
            <td>
This is needed for you to take photos and send them via the app. In addition, the camera access allows you to scan QR codes.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Microphone access (optional)</td>
            <td>

        </tr>

            <td>
This is needed if you want to share your location with a communication partner.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Background location access (optional)</td>
            <td>

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Contact access (optional)</td>
            <td>

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
Storage (optional)
            </td>
            <td>You can save images and files from the app to your device.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The processing and use of the above permissions are performed to provide the service. The internet access is necessary for the use, therefore the legal basis of the processing is [Art.6 (1) lit.a GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/), as you have a usage contract with us by using our services.

The optional permissions only take place based on your consent according to [Art.6 (1) lit.a GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) and can also be reduced to individual services, e.g. only internet usage to send messages without pictures or location data. Delta Chat does not receive any access to this data.

### 3. Platform dependent processing

Certain information is already processed automatically as soon as you use the app. We have listed below which personal data is processed exactly:

When you download the app, certain required information is transmitted to the app store you use ( e.g. Google Play or Apple App Store), in particular the username, the email address, the customer number of your account, the time of the download, payment information as well as the individual device identification number may be processed. The processing of this data is carried out exclusively by the respective app store and is beyond our control.

For the rest, we refer to the data protection policies of the respective app store providers or responsible parties of the operating systems. We do not collect and/or process any other data.

Your personal data will not be transferred to third parties for purposes other than those listed below.

# 4. Rights of the data subject
