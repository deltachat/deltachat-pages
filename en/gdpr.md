#  How **Delta Chat** complies to the **GDPR** 

- Implements the **Privacy by Design** requirement of the GDPR, through

  - **Confidentiality**: End-to-end encryption when possible, by implementing [Autocrypt
  Level 1](https://autocrypt.org).

  - **Data minimization**: No alignment or uploading of the address-book content.

  - **Data avoidance**: No Delta Chat server, no processing of personal data.

- Does not require any **consent** (article 7 GDPR) from the users or their contacts (data subjects), because no address-book-data is transmitted.

- Can be used **without requiring a contract or instructions** from any controller (organisation), because no additional third party will process the E-Mail related personal data. 




# How data controllers (organizations) benefit from using Delta Chat in complying to the GDPR

- Creates **no additional information requirements** for the controller towards direct or indirect data subjects 
  regarding any collection of address-book-data, article 13, 14 GDPR.

- Needs **no data protection impact assessment**  to be carry out for Delta Chat (Article 35 GDPR), because it processes no particular additional data beyond E-Mail messenging.

- Adding Delta Chat's privacy measures to the 
  **record of processing activities** can have a positive impact 
  on eventual **evidence documentation**, (article 30 GDPR) 
  as well as on the **data protection certification process**, Article 25 (3), 42 GDPR.

- The **record of processing activities** linked to the messenger-communication is
  reduced to identifying the email-providers and recording their activities, Article 30 (2) GDPR.

- Remaining risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons 
  are generally also limited to the communication data processed 
  by the controller and the email providers.



This statement reflects the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as of 16.05.2018.
