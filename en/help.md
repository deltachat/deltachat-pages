## What is Delta Chat?

Delta Chat is a reliable, decentralized and secure messaging app, 
available for mobile and desktop platforms.

Delta Chat feels like Whatsapp or Telegram but you can also use and regard it as an e-mail app. 
You can signup anonymously to a variety of [interoperable chatmail servers](https://delta.chat/chatmail)
which are minimal e-mail servers optimized for fast and secure operations. 
Or you may use classic e-mail servers and an existing e-mail account
in which case Delta Chat acts as an e-mail app.

### How can I find people to chat with? 

To securely setup contact with others [scan an invite QR code 
or share an invite link](#howtoe2ee). 
This is required when using a (default) chatmail-based chat profile 
because chatmail servers reject un-encrypted outgoing messages.

If you create a chat profile with a classic e-mail address 
you may manually create a contact if you know their e-mail address
and then write a message to them 
even if the recipient is not using Delta Chat.


### What are the advantages of Delta Chat compared to other messengers?

- Anonymous chat profiles with fast, secure and interoperable [chatmail servers](https://delta.chat/chatmail)
  which offer instant Push Notifications for iOS and Android devices. 

- Pervasive [multi-profile](#multiple-accounts) and multi-device support on all platforms. 

- Interactive [web apps in chats](https://webxdc.org/apps) for gaming and collaboration

- [Audited end-to-end encryption](#security-audits) 
  safe against network and server attacks. 

- Free and Open Source software, both app and server side. 
  Built on [E-mail and Web Internet Standards]({% include standards-url %}),
  [to avoid "yet another standard syndrome (xkcd 927)"](https://xkcd.com/927/) 


### What if I expect a message from someone I didn't write to in the past?

If a message comes from an unknown contact, it appears as a **request**.

- You need to **accept** the request before you can reply.

- You can also **delete** it if you don't want to chat with them for now.

- If you delete a request, future messages from that contact will still appear
  as message request, so you can change your mind. If you really don't want to
  receive messages from this person, consider **blocking** them.


### Does Delta Chat support images, videos and other attachments?

- Yes. Images, videos, files, voice messages etc. are handled as usual.

- For performance, images are optimized and sent at a smaller size by default, but you can send it as a "file" to preserve the original.


### What are profiles? How can I switch between them? {#multiple-accounts}

A profile is **a name, a picture** and some additional information for encrypting messages.
A profile lives on your device(s) only
and uses a chatmail or a classic e-mail server to transport messages.

On first installation of Delta Chat a first profile is created.

Later, you can tap your profile image in the upper left corner to **Add Profiles**
or to **Switch Profiles**.

You may want to use separate profiles for political, family or work related activities,
or e. g. for a dedicated "spam-profile" with which you register at websites and platforms
that tend to cause unsolicited messages ("spam") sooner or later.

You may also wish to learn [how to use the same profile on multiple devices](#multiclient).


### Who sees my profile picture?

- You can add a profile picture in your settings. If you write to your contacts
  or add them via QR code, they automatically see it as your profile picture.

- Contacts who don't use Delta Chat do not see the profile picture
  (however, of course, they can install Delta Chat :)

- For privacy reasons, no one sees your profile picture until you write a
  message to them.

- Your profile picture isn't sent with every message, but regularly enough that
  your contacts will re-receive your profile picture, even if they add a new
  device.


### Can I set a Bio/Signature/Status/Motto with Delta Chat? {#signature}

Yes,
you can do so under **Settings → Profile → Bio**.
Your contacts who use Delta Chat will see it
when they view your contact details.
Moreover, it will appear as a classic e-mail signature.


### What do Pinning, Muting and Archiving mean?

Use these tools to organize your chats and keep everything in its place:

- **Pinned chats** always stay atop of the chat list. You can use them to access your most loved chats quickly or temporarily to not forget about things.

- **Mute chats** if you do not want to get notifications for them. Muted chats stay in place and you can also pin a muted chat.

- **Archive chats** if you do not want to see them in your chat list any longer.
  Archived chats remain accessible above the chat list or via search. 

- When an archived chat gets a new message, unless muted, it will **pop out of the archive** and back into your chat list.
  **Muted chats stay archived** until you unarchive them manually.

To use the functions, long tap or right click a chat in the chat list.


### How do "Saved Messages" work? {#save}

**Saved Messages** is a chat that you can use to easily remember and find messages.

- In any chat, long tap or right click a message and select **Save**

- Saved messages are marked by the symbol
  <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/saved-icon.png" alt="Saved icon"/>
  next to the timestamp

- Later, open the "Saved Messages" chat - and you will see the saved messages there.
  By tapping <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/go-to-original.png" alt="Arrow-right icon"/>,
  you can go back to the original message in the original chat

- Finally, you can also use "Save Messages" to take **personal notes** - open the chat, type something, add a photo or a voice message etc.

- As "Saved Message" are synced, they can become very handy for transferring data between devices

Messages stay saved even if they are edited or deleted -
may it be by [sender](#edit), by [device cleanup](#delold) or by [disappearing messages of other chats](#ephemeralmsgs).


### What does the green dot mean?

You can sometimes see a **green dot** <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/green-dot.png" alt=""/>
next to the avatar of a contact.
It means they were **recently seen** in the last 10 minutes:

- either because they messaged you directly,
- because they wrote something to a group you are both a member of,
- because they sent you a read receipt for a message you wrote,
- because they edit or delete a message in a chat shared with you,
- or because they use an [app](#webxdc) in a chat shared with you.

So this is not a real time online status -
and if someone doesn't answer right away even though they seem to be online,
don't worry and give them some space :)

On the other hand, others will not always "see that you are online".
If you have turned off read receipts,
they will not see the green dot
until one of the above conditions are met.


### What do the ticks shown beside outgoing messages mean?

- **One tick** means that the message was sent successfully to your provider.
- **Two ticks** mean that at least one recipient's device
  reported back to having received the message.
- Recipients may have disabled read-receipts,
  so even if you see only one tick, the message may have been read.
- The other way round, two ticks do not automatically mean
  that a human has read or understood the message ;)


### Correct typos and delete messages after sending {#edit}

- You can edit the text of your messages after sending.
  For that, long tap or right click the message and select **Edit**
  or <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/edit-icon.png" alt="Edit icon"/>.

- If you have sent a message accidentally,
  from the same menu, select **Delete** and then **Delete for Everyone**.

While edited messages will have the word "Edited" next to the timestamp,
deleted messages will be removed without a marker in the chat.
Notifications are not sent and there is no time limit.

Note, that the original message may still be received by chat members
who could have already replied, forwarded, saved, screenshotted or otherwise copied the message.


### How do disappearing messages work? {#ephemeralmsgs}

You can turn on "disappearing messages"
in the settings of a chat,
at the top right of the chat window,
by selecting a time span
between 5 minutes and 1 year.

Until the setting is turned off again,
each chat member's Delta Chat app takes care
of deleting the messages
after the selected time span.
The time span begins
when the receiver first sees the message in Delta Chat.
The messages are deleted
both in each email account on the server,
and in the app itself.

Note that you can rely on disappearing messages
only as long as you trust your chat partners;
malicious chat partners can take photos,
or otherwise save, copy or forward messages before deletion.

Apart from that,
if one chat partner uninstalls Delta Chat,
the messages will not get deleted from their email account.
They will most likely also not be decryptable anymore
(as long as they were encrypted in the first place).


### What happens if I turn on "Delete old messages from server"?

- By default, Delta Chat stores all messages locally on your device.
  If you  e.g. want to save storage space at your mail provider,
  you can configure  Delta Chat
  to delete old already-received messages on the server automatically.
  They still remain on your device until you delete them there, too.

- To turn it on, go to **Delete Old Messages → Delete Messages from Server**
  in the "Chats and Media" settings.
  You can set a timeframe between "At once" and "After 1 year".
  All e-mails received by Delta Chat will be deleted from the server after this timeframe.

- Note that if you use Delta Chat on more than one device,
  you need to leave the message on the server with a sufficient timeframe
  so that the other device(s) can download them, too.


### What happens if I turn on "Delete old messages from device"? {#delold}

- If you want to save storage on your device, you can choose to delete old
  messages automatically.
- To turn it on, go to "delete old messages from device" in the "Chats & Media"
  settings. You can set a timeframe between "after an hour" and "after a year";
  this way, *all* messages will be deleted from your device as soon as they are
  older than that.


## Groups

### Creation of a group

- Select **New chat** and then **New group** from the menu in the upper right corner or hit the corresponding button on Android/iOS.
- On the following screen, select the **group members** and define a **group name**. You can also select a **group avatar**.
- As soon as you write the **first message** in the group, all members are informed about the new group and can answer in the group (as long as you do not write a message in the group the group is invisible to the members).


### Add members to a group

- Every group member has the **same rights** as any other. For this reason every one can delete every member or add new ones.
- To add or delete members, click on the group name in the chat.


### I have deleted myself by accident.

- As you're no longer a group member, you cannot add yourself again. 
  However, no problem, just ask any other group member in a normal chat to re-add you.


### I do not want to receive the messages of a group any longer.

- Either delete yourself from the member list or delete the whole chat. 
  If you want to join the group again later on, ask another group member to add you again.

- As an alternative, you can also "Mute" a group - doing so means you get all messages and 
  can still write, but are no longer notified of any new messages.


## Instant message delivery and Push Notifications {#instant-delivery}


### What are Push Notifications? How can I get instant message delivery?

Push Notifications are sent by Apple and Google "Push services" to a user's device
so that an inactive Delta Chat app can fetch messages in the background
and show notifications on a user's phone if needed.

Push Notifications work with all [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) servers on

- iOS devices, by integrating with Apple Push services.

- Android devices, by integrating with the Google FCM Push service,
  including on devices that use [microG](https://microg.org)
  instead of proprietary Google code on the phone.

As of May 2024, classic e-mail servers do not support Push Notifications
for Delta Chat users.


### Are Push Notifications enabled on iOS devices? Is there an alternative?

Yes, Delta Chat automatically uses Push Notifications for [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) profiles.
And no, there is no alternative on Apple's phones to achieve instant message delivery
because Apple devices do not allow Delta Chat to fetch data in the background.
Push notifications are automatically activated for iOS users because
[Delta Chat's privacy-preserving Push Notification system](#privacy-notifications)
does not expose data to Apple that it doesn't already have.


### Are Push notifications enabled / needed on Android devices? {#android-push}

If a "Push Service" is available, Delta Chat enables Push Notifications
to achieve instant message delivery for all chatmail users.
If you are using a classic e-mail provider instead of [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) servers,
Push Notifications are not available.

In the Delta Chat "Notifications" settings for "Instant delivery"
you can change the following settings effecting all chat profiles:

- Use Background Connection: If you are not using a Push service,
  you may disable "battery optimizations" for Delta Chat,
  allowing it to fetch messages in the background.
  However, there could be delays from minutes to hours.
  Some Android vendors even restrict apps completely
  (see [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com))
  and Delta Chat might not show  incoming messages
  until you manually open the app again.
  
- Force Background Connection: This is the fallback option
  if the previous options are not available or do not achieve "instant delivery".
  Enabling it causes a permanent notification on your phone
  which may sometimes be "minified" with recent Android phones.

Both "Background Connection" options are energy-efficient and
safe to try if you experience messages arrive only with long delays.


### How private are Delta Chat Push Notifications? {#privacy-notifications}

Delta Chat Push Notification support avoids leakage of private information.
It does not leak e-mail, IP address or message content (not even encrypted)
to any system involved in the delivery of Push Notifications.

Here is how Delta Chat apps perform Push Notification delivery:

- A Delta Chat app obtains a "device token" locally, encrypts it and stores it
  on the [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) server.

- When a [chatmail](https://delta.chat/chatmail) server receives an e-mail for a Delta Chat user
  it forwards the encrypted device token to the central Delta Chat notification proxy.

- The central Delta Chat notification proxy decrypts the device token
  and forwards it to the respective Push service (Apple, Google, etc.),
  without ever knowing the IP or e-mail address of Delta Chat users.

- The central Push Service (Apple, Google, etc.)
  wakes up the Delta Chat app on your device
  to check for new messages in the background.
  It does not know about the chatmail or e-mail address of the device it wakes up.
  The central Apple/Google Push services never see an e-mail address (sender or receiver)
  and also never see any message content (also not in encrypted forms).


The central Delta Chat notification proxy [is small and fully implemented in Rust](https://github.com/deltachat/notifiers)
and forgets about device-tokens as soon as Apple/Google/etc processed them,
usually in a matter of milliseconds.

Note that the device token is encrypted between apps and notification proxy
but it is not signed. 
The notification proxy thus never sees e-mail addresses, IP-addresses or
any cryptographic identity information associated with a user's device (token). 

Resulting from this overall privacy design, even the seizure of a chatmail server,
or the full seizure of the central Delta Chat notification proxy
would not reveal private information that Push services do not already have.


### Why does Delta Chat integrate with centralized proprietary Apple/Google push services?

Delta Chat is a free and open source decentralized messenger with free server choice,
but we want users to reliably experience "instant delivery" of messages,
like they experience from WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram apps,
without asking questions up-front that are more suited to expert users or developers.

Note that Delta Chat has a [small and privacy-preserving Push Notification system](#privacy-notifications)
that achieves "instant delivery" of messages for all chatmail servers
including a potential one [you might setup yourself without our permission](https://delta.chat/chatmail#selfhosted).
Welcome to the power of the interoperable and massive chatmail and e-mail system :)


## Encryption and Security {#e2ee}

### Which standards are used for end-to-end encryption? 

Delta Chat uses a [secure subset of the OpenPGP standard](#openpgp-secure)
to provide automatic end-to-end encryption using these protocols: 

- [Secure-Join](https://securejoin.delta.chat/en/latest/new.html)
  to exchange encryption setup information through QR-code scanning or "invite links". 

- [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org) is used for automatically
  establishing end-to-end encryption between contacts and all members of a group chat. 

- [Sharing a contact to a
  chat](https://github.com/chatmail/core/blob/main/spec.md#attaching-a-contact-to-a-message)
  enables receivers to use end-to-end encryption with the contact. 

Delta Chat does not query, publish or interact with any OpenPGP key servers. 

### How can i know if messages are end-to-end encrypted? {#whene2e}

All messages in Delta Chat are **end-to-end encrypted by default**.
Since the Delta Chat Version 2 release series (July 2025) 
there are no lock or similar markers on end-to-end encrypted messages, anymore. 

### Can i still receive or send mails without end-to-end encryption? 

If you use default [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays),
it is impossible to receive or send messages without end-to-end encryption. 

If you instead create a profile using a classic e-mail server,
you can send and receive messages with or without end-to-end encryption.
Messages lacking end-to-end encryption are marked with an e-mail icon
<img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.2em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/email-icon.png" alt="email"/>.

### How can I establish a chat with a new contact? {#howtoe2ee}

You can send an invite link through another private chat, 
show an invitation QR code when next to each other or in a video call,
or click on a "contact" that was shared in a chat. 

- For **Group invitations**,
  tap the chat group title to see its member list,
  and select "QR Invite code".

- For **direct 1:1 chat invitations**, 
  tap the QR Code icon <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.8em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/qr-icon.png" />
  on the Delta Chat app main screen.

Ask your chat partner to scan the QR image
with their Delta Chat app,
or click "Copy" or "Share" to create an invite link
and share it with your chat partner.

Now wait while [end-to-end encryption is getting established](https://securejoin.delta.chat/en/latest/new.html#setup-contact-protocol). 

- If both sides are online, they will soon see a (group or direct) chat
  and can start messaging securely. 

- If one side is offline or in bad network, 
  the  ability to chat is delayed until connectivity is restored. 

Congratulations! 
You now will automatically use end-to-end encryption
with this contact. 
If you add each other to chat groups,
end-to-end encryption will be established among all members. 


### What does the green checkmark in a contact profile mean? {#e2eeguarantee}

A contact profile might show a green checkmark
<img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.5em; margin:1px" src="../assets/help/green-checkmark.png" alt="green checkmark" />
and an "Introduced by" line.
Every green-checkmarked contact either did a direct [QR-scan](#howtoe2ee) with you
or was introduced by a another green-checkmarked contact.
Introductions happen automatically when adding members to groups. 
Whoever adds a green-checkmarked contact to a group with only green-checkmarked members 
becomes an introducer. 
In a contact profile you can tap on the "Introduced by ..." text repeatedly
until you get to the one with whom you directly did a [QR-scan](#howtoe2ee).

For more in-depth discussion of "guaranteed end-to-end encryption"
please see [Secure-Join protocols](https://securejoin.delta.chat/en/latest/new.html)
and specifically read about "Verified Groups", the technical term
of what is called here "green-checkmarked" or "guaranteed end-to-end encrypted" chats.

### Are attachments (pictures, files, audio etc.) end-to-end encrypted?

Yes.

When we talk about an "end-to-end encrypted message"
we always mean a whole message is encrypted,
including all the attachments
and attachment metadata such as filenames.


### Is OpenPGP secure? {#openpgp-secure}

Yes, Delta Chat uses a secure subset of OpenPGP
requiring the whole message to be properly encrypted and signed.
For example, "Detached signatures" are not treated as secure.

OpenPGP is not insecure by itself.
Most publicly discussed OpenPGP security problems
actually stem from bad usability or bad implementations of tools or apps (or both).
It is particularly important to distinguish between OpenPGP, the IETF encryption standard, 
and GnuPG (GPG), a command line tool implementing OpenPGP. 
Many public critiques of OpenPGP actually discuss GnuPG which Delta Chat has never used. 
Delta Chat rather uses the OpenPGP Rust implementation [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp),
available as [an independent "pgp" package](https://crates.io/crates/pgp),
and [security-audited in 2019 and 2024](#security-audits). 

We aim, along with other OpenPGP implementors, 
to further improve security characteristics by implementing the
[new IETF OpenPGP Crypto-Refresh](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh/) 
which was thankfully adopted in summer 2023. 


### Did you consider using alternatives to OpenPGP for end-to-end-encryption? {#openpgp-alternatives}

Yes, we are following efforts like [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security)
or [Saltpack](https://saltpack.org/) 
but adopting them would mean breaking end-to-end encryption interoperability 
with all other e-mail apps that typically support OpenPGP encryption. 
So it would not be a light decision to take 
and there must be tangible improvements for users. 

Delta Chat takes a holistic "usable security" approach 
and works with a wide range of activist groupings as well as 
renowned researchers such as [TeamUSEC](https://teamusec.de) 
to improve actual user outcomes against security threats. 
The wire protocol and standard for establishing end-to-end encryption is
only one part of "user outcomes",
see also our answers to [device-seizure](#device-seizure)
and [message-metadata](#message-metadata) questions. 


### Is Delta Chat vulnerable to EFAIL?

No, [Delta Chat never was vulnerable to EFAIL](https://delta.chat/en/2018-05-15-delta-chat-not-vulnerable-to-efail)
because its OpenPGP implementation [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp) 
uses Modification Detection Code when encrypting messages
and returns [an error](https://docs.rs/pgp/latest/pgp/errors/enum.Error.html#variant.MdcError)
if the Modification Detection Code is incorrect.

Delta Chat also never was vulnerable to the "Direct Exfiltration" EFAIL attack
because it only decrypts `multipart/encrypted` messages
which contain exactly one encrypted and signed part,
as defined by the Autocrypt Level 1 specification. 


### Are messages marked with the mail icon exposed on the Internet? {#tls}

If you are sending or receiving e-mail messages without end-to-end encryption (using a classic e-mail server),
they are still protected from cell or cable companies who can not read or modify your e-mail messages. 
But both your and your recipient's e-mail providers 
may read, analyze or modify your messages, including any attachments. 

Delta Chat by default uses strict 
[TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) 
which secures connections between your device and your e-mail provider. 
All of Delta Chat's TLS-handling has been independently [security audited](#security-audits).
Moreover, the connection between your and the recipient's e-mail provider
will typically be transport-encrypted as well.
If the involved e-mail servers support [MTA-STS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461)
then transport encryption will be enforced between e-mail providers 
in which case Delta Chat communications will never be exposed in cleartext to the Internet
even if the message was not end-to-end encrypted.


### How does Delta Chat protect metadata in messages? {#message-metadata}

Unlike most other messengers, 
Delta Chat apps do not store any metadata about contacts or groups on servers, also not in encrypted form. 
Instead, all group metadata is end-to-end encrypted and stored on end-user devices, only. 

E-mail Servers can therefore only see

- the message date, 

- sender and receiver addresses 

- and message size. 

All other message, contact and group metadata resides in the end-to-end encrypted part of messages. 

### How to protect metadata and contacts when a device is seized? {#device-seizure}

Both for protecting against metadata-collecting e-mail servers 
as well as against the threat of device seizure
we recommend to use a [chatmail relay](https://chatmail.at/relays)
to create chat profiles using random e-mail addresses for transport. 
Note that Delta Chat apps on all platforms support multiple profiles
so you can easily use situation-specific profiles next to your "main" profile
with the knowledge that all their data, along with all metadata, will be deleted.
Moreover, if a device is seized then chat contacts using short-lived profiles
can not be identified easily. 

### Does Delta Chat support "Sealed Sender"? {#sealedsender}

No, not yet. 

The Signal messenger introduced ["Sealed Sender" in 2018](https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/)
to keep their server infrastructure ignorant of who is sending a message to a set of recipients. 
It is particularly important because the Signal server knows the mobile number of each account,
which is usually associated with a passport identity.

Even if [chatmail relays](https://chatmail.at/relays) 
do not ask for any private data (including no phone numbers), 
it might still be worthwhile to protect relational metadata between addresses. 
We don't foresee bigger problems in using random throw-away e-mail addresses for sealed sending
but an implementation has not been agreed as a priority yet. 

### Does Delta Chat support Perfect Forward Secrecy? {#pfs}

No, not yet. 

Delta Chat today doesn't support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
This means that if your private decryption key is leaked,
and someone has collected your prior in-transit messages,
they will be able to decrypt and read them using the leaked decryption key.
Note that Forward Secrecy only increases security if you delete messages. 
Otherwise, someone obtaining your decryption keys
is typically also able to get all your non-deleted messages
and doesn't even need to decrypt any previously collected messages. 

We designed a Forward Secrecy approach that withstood 
initial examination from some cryptographers and implementation experts 
but is pending a more formal write up 
to ascertain it reliably works in federated messaging and with multi-device usage,
before it could be implemented in [chatmail core](https://github.com/chatmail/core),
which would make it available in all [chatmail clients](https://chatmail.at/clients). 

### Does Delta Chat support Post-Quantum-Cryptography? {#pqc}

No, not yet. 

Delta Chat uses the Rust OpenPGP library [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp)
which supports the latest [IETF Post-Quantum-Cryptography OpenPGP draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc/). 
We aim to add PQC support in [chatmail core](https://github.com/chatmail/core)  after the draft is finalized at the IETF
in collaboration with other OpenPGP implementers. 

### How can I manually check encryption information?

You may check the end-to-end encryption status manually in the "Encryption" dialog
(user profile on Android/iOS or right-click a user's chat-list item on desktop).
Delta Chat shows two fingerprints there.
If the same fingerprints appear on your own and your contact's device,
the connection is safe.

### Can I reuse my existing private key? {#importkey}

No. 

Delta Chat generates secure OpenPGP keys according to the Autocrypt specification 1.1. 
You can export your private key but you can not import additional private keys. 

In general, we do not recommend or offer users to perform manual key management. 
We want to ensure that security audits can focus on a few proven cryptographic algorithms 
instead of the full breadth of possible algorithms allowed with OpenPGP. 

### Was Delta Chat independently audited for security vulnerabilities? {#security-audits}

Yes, multiple times. 
The Delta Chat project continuously undergoes independent security audits and analysis,
from most recent to older: 

- 2024 December, an [NLNET-commissioned Evaluation of
  rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/docs/blob/main/audits/NGI%20Core%20rPGP%20penetration%20test%20report%202024%201.0.pdf) by [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) took place.
  rPGP serves as the end-to-end encryption [OpenPGP](https://openpgp.org) engine of Delta Chat. 
  Two advisories were released related to the findings of this audit:

  - ["Panics on Malformed Untrusted Input"](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp/security/advisories/GHSA-9rmp-2568-59rv) CVE-2024-53856
  - ["Potential Resource Exhaustion when handling Untrusted Messages"](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp/security/advisories/GHSA-4grw-m28r-q285) CVE-2024-53857

  The issues outlined in these advisories have been fixed and are part of Delta Chat 
  releases on all appstores since December 2024. 

- 2024 March, we received a deep security analysis from the Applied Cryptography
  research group at ETH Zuerich and addressed all raised issues. 
  See our blog post about [Hardening Guaranteed End-to-End encryption](https://delta.chat/en/2024-03-25-crypto-analysis-securejoin) for more detailed information and the
  [Cryptographic Analysis of Delta Chat](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/918.pdf) 
  research paper published afterwards. 

- 2023 April, we fixed security and privacy issues with the "web
  apps shared in a chat" feature, related to failures of sandboxing
  especially with Chromium. We subsequently got an independent security
  audit from Cure53 and all issues found were fixed in the 1.36 app series released in April 2023.
  See [here for the full background story on end-to-end security in the web](https://delta.chat/en/2023-05-22-webxdc-security).

- 2023 March, [Cure53](https://cure53.de) analyzed both the transport encryption of
  Delta Chat's network connections and a reproducible mail server setup as
  [recommended on this site](serverguide).
  You can read more about the audit [on our blog](https://delta.chat/en/2023-03-27-third-independent-security-audit)
  or read the [full report here](../assets/blog/MER-01-report.pdf).

- 2020, [Include Security](https://includesecurity.com) analyzed Delta
  Chat's Rust [core](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/),
  [IMAP](https://github.com/async-email/async-imap),
  [SMTP](https://github.com/async-email/async-smtp), and
  [TLS](https://github.com/async-email/async-native-tls) libraries.
  It did not find any critical or high-severity issues.
  The report raised a few medium-severity weaknesses -
  they are no threat to Delta Chat users on their own
  because they depend on the environment in which Delta Chat is used.
  For usability and compatibility reasons,
  we can not mitigate all of them
  and decided to provide security recommendations to threatened users.
  You can read the [full report here](../assets/blog/2020-second-security-review.pdf).

- 2019, [Include Security](https://includesecurity.com) analyzed Delta
  Chat's [PGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp) and
  [RSA](https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA) libraries.
  It found no critical issues,
  but two high-severity issues that we subsequently fixed.
  It also revealed one medium-severity and some less severe issues,
  but there was no way to exploit these vulnerabilities in the Delta Chat implementation.
  Some of them we nevertheless fixed since the audit was concluded.
  You can read the [full report here](../assets/blog/2019-first-security-review.pdf).



## Multi-client {#multiclient}

### Can I use Delta Chat on multiple devices at the same time?

Yes. You can use the same profile on different devices:

- Make sure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi or network

- On the first device, go to **Settings → Add Second Device**, unlock the screen if needed
  and wait a moment until a QR code is shown

- On the second device, [install Delta Chat](https://get.delta.chat)

- On the second device, start Delta Chat, select **Add as Second Device**, and scan the QR code from the old device

- Transfer should start after a few seconds and during transfer both devices will show the **progress**.
  Wait until it is finished on both devices.

In contrast to many other messengers, after successful transfer,
both **devices are completely independent.**
One device is not needed for the other to work.


### Troubleshooting

- Double-check both devices are in the **same Wi-Fi or network**

- On **Windows**, go to **Control Panel / Network and Internet**
  and make sure, **Private Network** is selected as "Network profile type"
  (after transfer, you can change back to the original value)

- On **iOS**, make sure "System Settings / Apps / Delta Chat / **Local Network**" access is granted

- On **macOS**, enable "System Settings / Privacy & Security / **Local Network** / Delta Chat"

- Your system might have a "personal firewall",
  which is known to cause problems (especially on Windows).
  **Disable the personal firewall** for Delta Chat on both ends and try again

- **Guest Networks** may not allow devices to communicate with each other.
  If possible, use a non-guest network.

- If you still have troubles using the same network,
  try to open **Mobile Hotspot** on one device and join that Wi-Fi from the other one

- Ensure there is **enough storage** on the destination device

- If transfer started, make sure, the devices **stay active** and do not fall asleep.
  Do not exit Delta Chat.
  (we try hard to make the app work in background, but [systems tend to kill apps](https://dontkillmyapp.com), unfortunately)

- Delta Chat is **already logged in** on the destination device?
  You can use multiple profiles per device, just [add another profile](#multiple-accounts)

- If you still have problems or if you **cannot scan a QR code**
  try the **manual transfer** described below


### Manual Transfer {#backup}

This method is only recommended if "Add Second Device" as described above does not work.

- On the old device, go to "Settings -> Chats and media -> Export Backup". Enter your
  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. Then you can click on "Start
  Backup". This saves the backup file to your device. Now you have to transfer
  it to the other device somehow.
- On the new device, in the "I already have a profile" menu,
  choose "restore from backup". After import, your conversations, encryption
  keys, and media should be copied to the new device.
  - **If you use iOS:** and you encounter difficulties, maybe
    [this guide](https://support.delta.chat/t/import-backup-to-ios/1628) will
    help you.
- You are now synchronized, and can use both devices for sending and receiving
  end-to-end encrypted messages with your communication partners.

### Is Deletion, Pinning, Archiving, Saving, Muting etc. synced to all devices?

Yes.

If you e.g. delete a chat or a message from your phone,
it will be deleted on your desktop as soon as it comes online again.

Notable exceptions are [Delete old messages from Device](#delold),
as different devices may have different storage capacities,
and system specific settings as notification sounds.


### Are there any plans for introducing a Delta Chat Web Client?

- There are no immediate plans but some preliminary thoughts.
- There are 2-3 avenues for introducing a Delta Chat Web Client, but all are
  significant work. For now, we focus on getting stable releases into all
  app stores (Google Play/iOS/Windows/macOS/Linux repositories) as native apps.
- If you need a Web Client, because you are not allowed to install software on
  the computer you work with, you can use the portable Windows Desktop Client,
  or the AppImage for Linux. You can find them on
  [get.delta.chat](https://get.delta.chat).


## webxdc apps {#webxdc}

In Delta Chat, you can share [webxdc apps](https://webxdc.org), attachments with an `.xdc` file
extension. They can do very different things, and make Delta Chat a truly
extendable messenger.


### How private are webxdc apps?

- webxdc apps can not send data to the Internet, or download anything.
- A webxdc app can only exchange data within a Delta Chat chat, with its
  copies on the devices of your chat partners. Other than that, it's completely
  isolated from the Internet.
- The privacy a webxdc app offers is the privacy of your chat - as long as you
  trust the people you chat with, you can trust the webxdc app as well.
- This also means: it can be a privacy risk to open apps in chats with untrusted members.
  Just like with e-mail attachments, video calls or plain links:
  open them only from senders you trust, and not from spammers.
  Spammers can get to know any data you send to them, as well as your IP address.


### Where can I get webxdc apps?

- In general, anyone can share webxdc apps with each
  other without restrictions.
- From [webxdc.org/apps](https://webxdc.org/apps/).
- You can [send 'hi' to xstore@testrun.org](https://delta.chat/en/2023-08-11-xstore)
  to see an experimental webxdc appstore.
  All of the apps are open source and for free.
- Many people write their own webxdc apps and post them to [the Delta Chat
  forum](https://support.delta.chat/c/webxdc/20).


### How can I create my own webxdc apps?

- webxdc apps are just zip files containing html, css, and javascript code.
- You can extend the [Hello World example app](https://github.com/webxdc/hello)
  to get started.
- All else you need to know is written in the
  [documentation](https://docs.webxdc.org/).
- If you have question, you can ask others with experience in the [Delta Chat
  Forum](https://support.delta.chat/c/webxdc/20).


## Experimental Features

We are very grateful for feedback on these features - do you want to share
your ideas? Join the [Forum](https://support.delta.chat) to contribute. 
You may conveniently login via Delta Chat and a QR code scan,
another rather stable experiment we run on the side (sic!).

### How can I use audio/video calls with Delta Chat?

- To turn on audio/video calls, go to the "experimental features" section in
  the advanced settings and choose a "Video Chat Instance". 
- When you invite others to a video chat, it is opened in your browser/app at
  once. The others receive an e-mail with a link to the video chat. 
  This way, it is also compatible if your chat partners don't use Delta Chat.
- Note that there is no ring tone on the other side, and your chat partners
  will not get interrupted by a video chat invite.
- You can use any video chat service which allows joining by link. Just add the
  link in the settings.
- For example, to use the flagship Jitsi Meet instance, you could enter
  `https://meet.jit.si/$ROOM`. The `$ROOM` variable will be a random value;
  this way, you will have a new random Jitsi room every time you call someone.


### What are Broadcast Lists and how can I use them?

With a Broadcast List you can send a message to many recipients at once;
the recipients cannot reply in that list.
Broadcast lists are still highly experimental
and will very probably be replaced by something else, stay tuned :)


### How can I share my location with my chat partners?

- You can turn on location streaming in the "experimental features" section of
  the advanced settings.
- Now, if you want to share your location in a chat, go to "attach" and select
  "location". You can now set a time frame in which your location will be
  streamed to your chat partners, between 5 minutes and 6 hours.
- When your location changes, the others in the chat can view it on a map in
  the chat.
- To see the map and view locations of others, you need to turn on the feature
  in the advanced settings.
- This feature will not share your location with anyone except your chat partners.
  Map tiles are downloaded from [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org).
- On desktop, the OS typically can't determine your location. Instead you can
  right click on the map and describe a location, which is sent to the chat as
  a message, but also appears on the map.


### How can I use a different e-mail address with my profile?

Note: 
Changing email addresses is temporarily disabled
because of ongoing changes to the DeltaChat core.
It should be available again in a few months.

1. Change your address in “Settings → Advanced → Password and Account” and
   enter the password of your new e-mail account (and if necessary, server settings).
   You will get an information notice about the fact that you are moving to a new address. 
   An additional notice will also show up in your "Device messages" chat. 

2. If possible, let your old e-mail provider forward all messages to your new address.

3. Tell your contacts that you changed your address. 
   Writing to guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chats and groups,
   will make them notice your move automatically 
   and they will continue chatting with you using your new address. 

Note that Delta Chat will not retrieve messages anymore from your old e-mail provider.
If you didn't configure your e-mail provider to forward messages (step 2.) 
only those contacts to whom you sent a message in a guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chat
will send messages to your new address. 

To learn more about this the details behind this, [read our blogpost on
it](https://delta.chat/en/2022-09-14-aeap).


## Miscellaneous

### Which permissions does Delta Chat need?

Depending on the operating system in use,
you may be asked to grant permissions to the app.
This is what Delta Chat does with these permissions:

- Camera *(can be disallowed)*
  - take pictures and videos: for sending Photos
- Contacts *(can be disallowed)*
  - read your contacts: to discover contacts to chat with
- Location *(can be disallowed)*
  - access approximate location (network location sources): for the location streaming feature
  - access precise location (GPS and network location sources): for the location streaming feature
- Microphone *(can be disallowed)*
  - record audio: for audio messages
- Storage *(can be disallowed)*
  - modify or delete the contents of your SD card: to download message attachments
  - read the contents of your SD card: to share files with your contacts
- Other app capabilities
  - change your audio settings: so you can choose ring tones and volume for notifications and audio messages
  - run at startup: so you don't have to start Delta Chat manually
  - control vibration: for notifications
  - view network connections: to connect to your E-Mail provider
  - prevent phone from sleeping: so you can easier copy the security code during the Autocrypt Setup Message
  - have full network access: to connect to your E-Mail provider
  - view Wi-Fi connections: to connect to your E-Mail provider
  - ask to ignore battery optimisations: for achieving "instant message delivery"


### Does Delta Chat work with _my_ e-mail-provider?

- With a rather good chance: Yes :)  
  However, some providers need special options to work properly,
  see [Provider Overview](https://providers.delta.chat)


### Can I use Delta Chat in parallel with other E-Mail apps?

Yes, but it is not recommended.

Parallel usage with the same E-Mail address might lead to the following inconveniences:

- Next to your Delta Chat notifications,
  you might also get notifications for (encrypted, so unreadable) chat mail messages
  in your other email app
- If Delta Chat is not running
  or "Advanced > Move automatically to the DeltaChat Folder" is disabled,
  encrypted Delta Chat messages might clutter the Inbox in your other E-Mail apps.

[Sieve rules](https://support.delta.chat/t/sieve-rule-to-move-deltachat-mails-to-deltachat-folder/288/10) can solve these problems.


### I want to manage my own server for Delta Chat. What do you recommend?

- Most mail servers will work well. But what we personally recommend is a
  chatmail relay server, as described [in this
  blogpost](https://delta.chat/en/2023-12-13-chatmail).
- You can find an [installation guide on GitHub](https://github.com/chatmail/relay).


### Why do I have to enter my E-Mail password into Delta Chat? Is this secure?

As with other E-Mail programs like Thunderbird, K9-Mail, or Outlook, the
program needs the password so you can use it to send and receive mails. Of course, the
password is stored only on your device. The password is only transmitted to
your E-Mail provider (when you login), which has access to your mails anyway.

As Delta Chat is Open Source, you can check the [Source
Code](https://github.com/chatmail/core/blob/main/src/login_param.rs)
if you want to verify that your credentials are handled securely. We are happy
about feedback which makes the app more secure for all of our users.


### Which messages do appear in Delta Chat?

By default, Delta Chat shows all e-mails.

At "Settings → Advanced → Show Classic E-Mails",
you can change this. You have these options:

- "No, chats only": Only messages sent by other Delta Chat users and replies to
  your Delta Chat messages are shown. This makes most sense if you use the same
  e-mail account for normal e-mails as well.
- "All": Delta Chat shows all e-mails that are sent to your email address. This
  makes sense if you want to use Delta Chat for all your e-mails, so no message
  gets lost. This is the default setting.
- "For accepted contacts": Delta Chat shows all e-mails from contacts with whom
  you already have a chat, but new chats only pop up for Delta Chat messages.
  This helps to decide on a case-by-case basis whether you want to have a
  conversation in Delta Chat or in a "normal" e-mail app.


### Does Delta Chat support HTML e-mails?

Yes, incoming HTML messages come with a "Show full message" button.
Outgoing messages always use plain text.


### Can I set the E-Mail Subject with Delta Chat?

Delta Chat sets (and [encrypts](#message-metadata)!) the classic e-mail subject
automatically to  the group name or to the sender name.

So if you want to set the subject yourself,
for example for a formal e-mail to a business contact,
you can create a group
with only yourself and the recipient(s).
Set the Chat Title to the Subject you want,
and then send your e-mail as the first message.
If the recipients don't use Delta Chat,
it will look like a normal,
formal e-mail to them.
You will get bonus professionalism points
if you set a [signature text](#signature).


### What is the "Send Copy to Self" setting good for?

Sending a copy of your messages to yourself ensures that you receive your own
messages on all devices. If you have multiple devices and don't turn it on, you
see only the messages from other people, and the messages you send from the
current device.

The copy is sent to the Inbox, and then moved to the DeltaChat folder; it's not
put into the "Sent" folder. Delta Chat *never* uploads anything to the Sent
folder because this would mean uploading a message twice (once through SMTP,
and once through IMAP to Sent folder).

The default setting for "Send Copy to Self" is "on".


### Why can I choose to watch the "Sent" folder?

The only reason one wants to watch the Sent folder is if you are using another
mail program (like Thunderbird) next to your Delta Chat app, and want your MUA
to participate in chat conversations.

However, we recommend using the Delta Chat Desktop Client; you can download it
on [get.delta.chat](https://get.delta.chat). The option to watch the "Sent"
folder might go away in the future. It was introduced at a time where there was
no Delta Chat Desktop client available on all platforms.


### Why can I choose not to watch the DeltaChat folder?

Some people use Delta Chat as a regular email client, and want to use the Inbox
folder for their mail, instead of the DeltaChat folder. If you disable "Watch
DeltaChat folder", you should also disable "move chat messages to DeltaChat".
Otherwise, deleting messages or multi-device setups might not work properly.


### Why can I choose to only watch the DeltaChat folder?

This is an experimental setting for some people who are experimenting with
server-side rules. Not all providers support this, but with some you can move
all mails with a "Chat-Version" header to the DeltaChat folder. Normally, this
would be done by the Delta Chat app.

Enabling "Only Fetch from DeltaChat folder" makes sense if you have **both**:

- enabled a server-side rule to move all messages with Chat-Version header to the DeltaChat folder, and
- have set the "Show classic emails" setting to "no, chats only".

In this case, Delta Chat doesn't need to watch the Inbox, and it's enough to only watch the DeltaChat folder.


### Is Delta Chat compatible with Proton Mail / Tutanota / Criptext?

- Yes and No.
- No, you can not use your Proton Mail, Tutanota, or Criptext account with Delta
  Chat; they do not offer receiving mails via IMAP.
- In any case you can use Delta Chat to send Messages to people who use
  Protonmail, Tutanota, or Criptext. Those messages will not be end-to-end
  encrypted, though. The end-to-end encryption those providers offer is not
  compatible with [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org/), the standard Delta Chat
  uses.
- Delta Chat can end-to-end-encrypt through any e-mail provider with any
  [Autocrypt-enabled e-mail app](https://autocrypt.org/dev-status.html).


### How can I delete my account? {#remove-account}

If you use a default chat profile
you can simply uninstall the app.
This will automatically trigger deletion of all associated account data on the chatmail server.
For more info, please refer to [nine.testrun.org account-deletion](https://nine.testrun.org/info.html#account-deletion) for the default onboarding server,
or the respective page from your chosen [3rd party chatmail server](https://delta.chat/chatmail).

If you have set up your chat profile on multiple devices
you need to remove it from all devices.

If you are using more than one account,
but don't want to get rid of all of them,
you can remove it in the account switcher menu (on android and iOS),
or in the sidebar with a right click (in the desktop client).

Accounts on [classic e-mail providers](https://providers.delta.chat)
will not be deleted automatically;
how you can delete your account depends on your e-mail provider.
We don't have any control over e-mail accounts at those providers,
so unfortunately we can't help you with that.

If you want to continue using a classic e-mail account with other apps,
but uninstall Delta Chat,
it is recommended to leave any group chat before uninstalling Delta Chat.
Otherwise you might receive undecryptable messages from those group chats.


### I'm interested in the technical details. Can you tell me more?

- See [Standards used in Delta Chat]({% include standards-url %}).



### Where can my friends find Delta Chat?

Delta Chat is available for all major and some minor platforms:

- The **official website**, <https://delta.chat/download> shows all options in detail

- If unavailable, use the **mirror** at <https://deltachat.github.io/deltachat-pages>

- Open one of the following **app stores and search for "Delta Chat":**
  Google Play Store, F-Droid, Huawei App Gallery, Amazon App Store, iOS and macOS App Store, Microsoft Store

- Check the **package manager** of your Linux distributions

- **Android APKs** are also available on <https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/releases>


### How are Delta Chat developments funded? 

Delta Chat does not receive any Venture Capital and
is not indebted, and under no pressure to produce huge profits, or to 
sell users and their friends and family to advertisers (or worse). 
We rather use public funding sources, so far from EU and US origins, to help
our efforts in instigating a decentralized and diverse chat messaging eco-system
based on Free and Open-Source community developments.

Concretely, Delta Chat developments have so far been funded from these sources,
ordered chronologically: 

- The [NEXTLEAP](https://nextleap.eu) EU project funded the research
  and implementation of verified groups and setup contact protocols
  in 2017 and 2018 and also helped to integrate end-to-end Encryption
  through [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org).

- The [Open Technology Fund](https://opentechfund.org) gave us a 
  first 2018/2019 grant (~$200K) during which we majorly improved the Android app 
  and released a first Desktop app beta version, and which moreover 
  moored our feature developments in UX research in human rights contexts, 
  see our concluding [Needfinding and UX report](https://delta.chat/en/2019-07-19-uxreport).
  The second 2019/2020 grant (~$300K) helped us to 
  release Delta/iOS versions, to convert our core library to Rust, and
  to provide new features for all platforms.  

- The [NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) granted in 2019/2020 EUR 46K for
  completing Rust/Python bindings and instigating a Chat-bot eco-system. 

- In 2021 we received further EU funding for two Next-Generation-Internet
  proposals, namely for [EPPD - e-mail provider portability directory](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/eppd/) (~97K EUR) and [AEAP - email address porting](https://nlnet.nl/project/EmailPorting/) (~90K EUR) which resulted in better multi-profile support, improved QR-code contact and group setups and many networking improvements on all platforms.

- From End 2021 till March 2023 we received *Internet Freedom* funding (500K USD) from the
  U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL). 
  This funding supported our long-running goals to make Delta Chat more usable 
  and compatible with a wide range of e-mail servers world-wide, and more resilient and secure
  in places often affected by internet censorship and shutdowns.

- 2023-2024 we successfully completed the OTF-funded 
  [Secure Chatmail project](https://www.opentech.fund/projects-we-support/supported-projects/secure-chat-mail-with-delta-chat/), 
  allowing us to introduce guaranteed encryption, 
  creating a [chatmail server network](https://delta.chat/chatmail) 
  and providing "instant onboarding" in all apps released from April 2024 on. 

- In 2023 and 2024 we got accepted in the Next Generation Internet (NGI)
  program for our work in [webxdc PUSH](https://nlnet.nl/project/WebXDC-Push/),
  along with collaboration partners working on 
  [webxdc evolve](https://nlnet.nl/project/Webxdc-Evolve/), 
  [webxdc XMPP](https://nlnet.nl/project/WebXDC-XMPP/), 
  [DeltaTouch](https://nlnet.nl/project/DeltaTouch/) and 
  [DeltaTauri](https://nlnet.nl/project/DeltaTauri/). 
  All of these projects are partially completed or to be completed in early 2025. 

- Sometimes we receive one-time donations from private individuals. 
  For example, in 2021 a generous individual bank-wired us 4K EUR 
  with the subject "keep up the good developments!". 💜 
  We use such money to fund development gatherings or to care for ad-hoc expenses 
  that can not easily be predicted for, or reimbursed from, public funding grants. 
  Receiving more donations also helps us to become more independent and long-term viable
  as a contributor community. 

  [Donate Money](donate){: .cta-button}

- Last but by far not least, several pro-bono experts and enthusiasts contributed 
  and contribute to Delta Chat developments without receiving money, or only 
  small amounts. Without them, Delta Chat would not be where it is today, not
  even close. 

The monetary funding mentioned above is mostly organized by merlinux GmbH in
Freiburg (Germany), and is distributed to more than a dozen contributors world-wide. 

Please see [Delta Chat Contribution channels](contribute)
for both monetary and other contribution possibilities.
