# Donate Money

Delta Chat is developed by a dedicated FOSS (Free and open-source software) contributor community that jointly releases refinements and new features several times a year, across many stores and platforms world-wide. As a pure community project, it is funded solely through donations and fundings.

With your support, we can drive the development of DeltaChat forward and further expand its functionality. Your donation helps us shape the future of digital communication - without surveillance, advertising, or data monopolies.

Become part of the DeltaChat community and contribute to building an independent, secure messaging solution. Every donation, no matter how small, is an important contribution towards more digital self-determination.
