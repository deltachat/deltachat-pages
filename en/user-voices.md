# User Stories and Voices

### more fun with e-mail

_"A somewhat weird observation: sending and receiving emails with #DeltaChat makes the whole experience more enjoyable than using a traditional email client. I guess it's about the modern approach: making emails looks like chat messages."_

**Polish user** on [Mastodon](https://101010.pl/@michal/107107322703871076)

### supports more than one account

_"Hi Delta.chat team! Thanks for the app ; it is both extremely useful and the UX is near-to-perfect. Could you offer us easy switching between e-mail accounts? [...]."_  
**User,** before we improved multiple accounts, on [mastodon](https://oc.todon.fr/@borispaing/106607795144753681)

### audio and video call possible

_"Coolest thing is it supports video and audio calls by creating a jitsi room and sending an invite, cool solution:)"_

**User** on [Mastodon](https://masto.1146.nohost.me/@lps/106303722917783273)

### Can recommend to blind people

_"I installed Delta Chat last night, just after writing to you,
and I immediately noticed the improvement in accessibility [...]
And it works! And it's accessible! And I can recommend the app to other blind people!                                 
Good job guys! [...]"_

**Blind user** about the Android version in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu

### Popular in regions with strict Internet governance

_"There's this nice messenger, based on a simple email, called Delta Chat. I am happy that our Internet watchdog has made this app popular by trying to block it. It's just like with Telegram that has become widely popular across non-tech audiences after the ban"._ 

**Russian user** from 2020 in response to Delta Chat's rejection to satisfy Russian Internet watchdog RKN's request for user data, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Alex0s/status/1256841124427313153)

### Chatty interface with robust encryption

_"Other things I know I'm late to the party on but delta-chat seems really neat, especially if you have privacy concerns, since it's really just a specialized encryption heavy email client that presents a chat interface"_

**American user** from 2020 recommending Delta Chat for everyday usage

### Works during Internet shutdowns

_"I was happy that I could get Delta Chat from the website, not just via Google Play since it was blocked in Belarus. It was a bit slow to get the apk, but once I got the app, it worked just fine. We could share some photos and even videos encrypted"_ 

**Belarusian user** during protests in August 2020, via email to delta@merlinux.eu

### Company notification system migrated

_"Yes, our company have migrated
all billing/outage notification systems
from Telegram to Delta Chat
in order to improve corporate secrecy,
thus our cameras send intrusion detection alerts
to a delta group chat."_

**Early user** from 2018 from the [support forum](https://support.delta.chat/t/clear-chat-function/163/8)


### E-Mail always works

_"I'm really happy that DeltaChat exists and that I discovered it.
As a very early WhatsApp user, I quit WhatsApp because of privacy and security reasons;
I still have broken contacts because of that,
I do a lot of advertising for alternatives, but the market is just too fragmented.
Delta is THE solution for everyone who allow at least one
alternative - e-mail always works! :)"_

**User from Germany** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Waiting for a long time

_"A great project, I've been waiting for a long time
for an end-to-end-encrypted chat application that gives a real alternative to the
different silos like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram etc."_

**User from Germany** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Messaging with Cuba

_"I'm going to confess my love for the application.
It is really amazing, it has made me communicate more with my friends,
because writing emails is really annoying for me, I prefer chat, the world prefers chat."_

**User from Cuba** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Fully Decentralized

_"At /e/ we had lots of discussion about Telegram vs Signal vs ... 
But I must say that the best IM secured service in my opinion is @delta_chat
Delta Chat is using emails to transport instant messages: 
it's fully decentralized, heavily encrypted and you can reach any contact"_

**Gaël Duval**, Founder Mandrake Linux, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gael_duval/status/1122906779002777600)

### Decentralized but easy for users

_"People start caring about decentralization. But it seems that for a lot of people setting servers and all to use Matrix or XMPP is too complicated while you can use Delta with just an e-mail address"_

**Russian user** LGBT+ activist, from an online discussion over Telegram

### Good old email will do just fine

_"Recently I've come to the conclusion 
that the world doesn't need yet another instant messenger.
Good old email will do just fine.
Use #DeltaChat with your existing email account. #decentralize the net."_

**User from Poland** in 2020, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichalNarecki/status/1280820973902745600)


### Most decentralized communication concept currently available

_"Take the most decentralized communication concept currently available
and put on a chat app like @delta and you're done."_

**User from Germany** in 2020, via [Mastodon](https://mastodon.bayern/@binaryflo85/103273050438673883)


### Open-source, Non-silo, Standard-based

_"Been using  @delta_chat for more than a year:
great open-source/non-silo/standard-based replacement to whatsapp!
Glad to know that the development is keeping pace!!"_

**Séverin Lemaignan** in 2020, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skadge/status/1276515066393878529)


### A default way to start chats!

_"Considering to use  @delta_chat as a default way to start chats!
Unlike other systems it empowers people on both end with choice of the agent they want to use +
interops with all the mail clients"_

**gozala** in 2020 via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gozala/status/1281346020664729600)
