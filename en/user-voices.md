### Can recommend to blind people

_"I installed Delta Chat last night, just after writing to you,
and I immediately noticed the improvement in accessibility [...]
And it works! And it's accessible! And I can recommend the app to other blind people!                                 
Good job guys! [...]"_

**Blind user** about the Android version in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Company notification system migrated

_"Yes, our company have migrated
all billing/outage notification systems
from Telegram to Delta Chat
in order to improve corporate secrecy,
thus our cameras send intrusion detection alerts
to a delta group chat."_

**Early user** from from 2018 from the [support forum](https://support.delta.chat/t/clear-chat-function/163/6)


### E-Mail always works

_"I'm really happy that DeltaChat exists and that I discovered it.
As a very early WhatsApp user, I quit WhatsApp because of privacy and security reasons;
I still have broken contacts because of that,
I do a lot of advertising for alternatives, but the market is just too fragmented.
Delta is THE solution for everyone who allow at least one
alternative - e-mail always works! :)_

**User from Germany** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Waiting for a long time

_"A great project, I've been waiting for a long time
for an end-to-end-encrypted chat application that gives a real alternative to the
different silos like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram etc."_

**User from Germany** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Messaging with Cuba

_"I'm going to confess my love for the application.
It is really amazing, it has made me communicate more with my friends,
because writing emails is really annoying for me, I prefer chat, the world prefers chat."_

**User from Cuba** in 2019, via e-mail to delta@merlinux.eu


### Fully Decentralized

_"At /e/ we had lots of discussion about Telegram vs Signal vs ... 
But I must say that the best IM secured service in my opinion is @delta_chat
Delta Chat is using emails to transport instant messages: 
it's fully decentralized, heavily encrypted and you can reach any contact"_

**Gaël Duval**, Founder Mandrake Linux, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gael_duval/status/1122906779002777600)


### Good old email will do just fine

_"Recently I've come to the conclusion 
that the world doesn't need yet another instant messenger.
Good old email will do just fine.
Use #DeltaChat with your existing email account. #decentralize the net."_

**User from Poland** in 2020, via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichalNarecki/status/1280820973902745600)

### Open-source, Non-silo, Standard-based

great open-source/non-silo/standard-based replacement to whatsapp!
Glad to know that the development is keeping pace!!"_

### A default way to start chats!

_"Considering to use  @delta_chat as a default way to start chats!
Unlike other systems it empowers people on both end with choice of the agent they want to use +
interops with all the mail clients"_
