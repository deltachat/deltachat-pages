# Standards de la communauté Delta Chat

Dans le but de favoriser un environnement ouvert et accueillant, nous, les contributeur⋅rices et mainteneur⋅euses faisant en sorte que la participation à la communauté Delta Chat soit une expérience agréable et sans présence de harcèlement quel qu'il soit.


## Nos standards

Les comportements contribuant à un environnement favorable à la participation sont :

* Utiliser un langage inclusif et bienveillant
* Être respectueux⋅euse des différences de points de vue et expériences de tout le monde
* Recevoir positivement la critique constructive
* Être attentionné⋅e auprès des membres de la communauté et des membres arrivants
* Être aidant⋅e et participer à être médiateur⋅e lors de l'apparition de mécontentements ou de conflits

Examples of behavior which we ask everybody to avoid include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission

We recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or may be unaware of
the impact of their behaviour. When that happens, you may carefully remind
them in public or private, whatever is more appropriate. Assume good faith;
it's more likely that participants are unaware than that they are intentionally
trying to denigrate others or reduce the quality of discussion.


## Maintainers and Responsibilities

Project maintainers are those with commit rights to Delta Chat repositories or administrative rights to community communication channels.
Each maintainer is asked to take responsibility and appropriate, careful action
in response to witnessed instances of questionable behavior.
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to our standards.
They may also ban temporarily or permanently a contributor for
other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

Our Community Standards apply both within project communication channels and
gatherings as well as in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Responses

If you experience or witness abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
you can talk to select project maintainers, currently [Nami](mailto:missytake@systemli.org) and [Xenia](mailto:ksenia@transcyberian.org).
They will review reports and involve other maintainers as appropriate,
and will respond in a way that is deemed necessary and appropriate
to the circumstances, but not against your will.

Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Maintainers are themselves not exempt from being reported about
and may face temporary or permanent repercussions
as determined by other maintainers.
