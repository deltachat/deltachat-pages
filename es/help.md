## What is Delta Chat?

Delta Chat is a new chat app that sends messages via e-mails, encrypted if possible, with Autocrypt. 
**You do not have to sign up anywhere, just use your existing e-mail account with Delta Chat.** 


### How can I find people to chat with? 

With Delta Chat, you can write to every existing e-mail address - even
if the recipient is not using the Delta Chat app. No need for the
recipient to install the same app as yours, as with other messengers.


### What are the advantages of Delta Chat compared to other messengers?

- _Independent_ of any company or services. _You_ own your data.
- Your data is not saved on a central server unless all users are using
  the same e-mail servers
- You do not distribute your address book to anyone.
- _Fast_ by the use of Push-IMAP.
- _Largest userbase_ - recipients _not_ using Delta Chat can be reached as well.
- _Compatible_ - not only to itself.
- _Elegant_ and _simple_ user interface.
- _Distributed_ system.
- _No Spam_ - only messages of known users are shown by default.
- _Reliable_ - safe for professional use.
- _Trustworthy_ - can even be used for business messages.
- _Copyleft_ and _Standards_ based libre software.


### Which messages do appear in Delta Chat?

Delta Chat automatically shows:

- Mensajes de contactos en tu **libreta de direcciones**
- Mensajes de contactos **contactados por ti**
- **Respuestas** a mensajes enviados por ti

Other messages do not appear automatically, and are to be found in the main menu at **Contact requests**. If desired a chat can be started from there.


### What about spam?

- Messages in common spam folders are ignored and contained addresses are not considered as known contacts.
- As messages from unknown contacts do not pop up automatically, normally, there is **no spam**.
- However, if needed, you can **block** any contact.


### Does Delta Chat support images, videos and other attachments?

- Yes. Beside the plain text, all e-mail attachments are displayed as separate messages. Outgoing messages get attachments as needed automatically.


### Who sees my profile picture?

- You can add a profile picture in your settings. If you write to your contacts
  or add them via QR code, they automatically see it as your profile picture.

- Contacts who don't use Delta Chat see it as an E-Mail attachment.

- For privacy reasons, no one sees your profile picture until you write a
  message to them.

- Your profile picture isn't sent with every message, but regularly enough that
  your contacts will re-receive your profile picture, even if they add a new
  device.


### Does Delta Chat support HTML e-mails?

- Yes. If incoming e-mail lacks a plain text part, HTML-emails is converted to plain text in the app. Outgoing e-mails always use plain text.


### Why do I have to enter my E-Mail password into Delta Chat? Is this secure?

As with other E-Mail programs like Thunderbird, K9-Mail, or Outlook, the
program needs the password so you can use it to send mails. Of course, the
password is stored only on your device. The password is only transmitted to
your E-Mail provider (when you login), which has access to your mails anyway. 

If you use an E-Mail provider with OAuth2 support like gmail.com or yandex.ru,
there is no need to store your password on the device. In this case, only an
access token is used.

As Delta Chat is Open Source, you can check the [Source
Code](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/master/src/login_param.rs)
if you want to verify that your credentials are handled securely. We are happy
about feedback which makes the app more secure for all of our users.

  - ask to ignore battery optimisations: for users who want to receive messages all the time


## Groups

### Creation of a group

- Seleccione **Agregar grupo** desde el "Menú sándwich" en la esquina superior derecha de la descripción del chat.
- En la siguiente vista, seleccione los **miembros del grupo** y presione la marca de verificación en la esquina superior derecha. Después de eso, usted puede definir un **nombre de grupo**.
- Tan pronto como escriba **el primer mensaje**, se le informará a todos los miembros sobre el nuevo grupo y pueden responder en el grupo (hasta que no escriba un mensaje en el grupo, este es invisible para los miembros).


### Add members to a group

- Todos los miembros del grupo tienen los **mismos derechos** que los demás. Por esta razón, todos pueden eliminar o añadir miembros al grupo.
- Para añadir o eliminar miembros, haga clic en el nombre del grupo en la pantalla de chat.


### What is a verified group? Why is it experimental? 

- A verified group is a chat that gurantees safety against an active
  attacker.  All Messages in a verified chat view are e2e-encrypted, and
  members can join by scanning a "QR invite code".  All members are thus 
  connected with each other through a chain of invites, which guarantee 
  cryptographic consistency against active network or provider attacks. 
  See [countermitm.readthedocs.io](https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new.html)
  for the R&D behind this feature. 

- As of Dec 2019, a "verified group" remains an experimental feature.
  It is continously improved and many bugs have been fixed since the
  original introduction in 2018.  However, there remain cases, especially 
  with large groups where inconsistencies can occure, or messages become 
  unreadable.  Early 2020 a security review is upcoming, and several new
  developments around qr-join protocols are taking place so chances
  are we remove the "experimental" label not too far in the future. 


### I have deleted myself by accident.

- As you're no longer a group member, you cannot add yourself again. 
  However, no problem, just ask any other group member in a normal chat to re-add you.


### I do not want to receive the messages of a group any longer.

- Either delete yourself from the member list or delete the whole chat. 
  If you want to join the group again later on, ask another group member to add you again.

- As an alternative, you can also "Mute" a group - doing so means you get all messages and 
  can still write, but are no longer notified of any new messages.


## Encryption {#encryption}

### Does Delta Chat support end-to-end-encryption?

- Yes. Delta Chat implements the Autocrypt Level 1 standard and can 
  thus E2E-encrypt messages with other Autocrypt-capable apps. 


### What do I have to do to activate the end-to-end-encryption?

- Nada.

- Delta Chat apps (and other [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org)-compatible
  e-mail apps) share the keys required for end-to-end-encryption automatically 
  as the first messages are sent. 
  After this, all subsequent messages are encrypted end-to-end automatically. 
  If one of the chat partners uses a non-Autocrypt e-mail app, subsequent 
  messages are not encrypted until an Autocrypt-compliant app is available again. 

- If you want to _turn off_ the end-to-end-encryption, 
  use the corresponding setting in "Settings / Advanced settings".


### If end-to-end-encryption is not available, is the connection not encrypted at all?

- With most mail servers, Delta Chat establishes _transport encryption_
  ([TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)).
  This only secures the connection between your device and your e-mail
  server. Whereas e2e-encryption provides safety between 
  your device and a friend's device. 


### How can I verify cryptographic status with a sender? 

The user's profile shows some additional info:

- Tap "QR Invite code" on Android and then use the "Scan QR code"
  button on another device to scan this code. If both devices are online,
  they will introduce a chat channel with each-other (if it doesn't exist already) 
  and the encryption keys will also be verified.  Both will see a
  "sender verified" system message in their 1:1 chat. 

- For end-to-end-encryption, Delta Chat shows two fingerprints there. 
  If the same fingerprints appears on your chat partner's device, 
  the connection is safe.

- Para el cifrado de transporte, este estado se muestra allí.


### How can I check the encryption of messages?

- If a little **padlock** is shown beside a message, this denotes the message is end-to-end-encrypted _and_ is sent from the given sender _and_ that your answer will be end-to-end-encrypted as well.

- If there is **no padlock**, the message is usually transported unencrypted e.g. because you or the sender have turned off end-to-end-encryption, or the sender uses an app without support for end-to-end-encryption.


### Which standards are used for end-to-end-encryption?

- [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org) is used for establishing
  e2e-encryption with other Delta Chat and other Autocrypt-capable mail apps. 
  Autocrypt uses a limited subset of OpenPGP functionality. Moreover, 
  Delta Chat implements the "countermitm" protocols to achieve
  protection against active network attacks, going beyond the opportunistic
  base protection of Autocrypt, see questions about "Verified Groups".


### What is the difference between verified groups and 1:1 chats with verified contacts?

- 1:1 chats with a verified contact and verified groups are not the same, even
  if there are only 2 people in the verified group. One difference is that you
  could easily add more people to the group, but there are other implications as
  well.

- Verified groups are invariably secured. Any breakage (cleartext or wrongly
  signed messages etc.) will be flagged and such messages will not be shown in
  this chat. You can trust all messages in this verified-checkmark chat to have
  not been read/altered by middle parties.

- 1:1 chats are opportunistic, it is meant to allow people to communicate no
  matter if they change e-mail clients, devices, setups etc. That's why there
  is no verification checkmark, even if you have verified the contact.


### Does Delta Chat support Perfect Forward Secrecy?

- No, OpenPGP doesn't support Perfect Forward Secrecy. Perfect Forward Secrecy
  works session-oriented, but E-Mail is asynchronous by nature
  and often used from multiple devices independently. This means that if your
  Delta Chat private key is leaked, and someone has a record
  of all your in-transit messages, they will be able to read them.  

- Note that if anyone has seized or hacked your running phone, they will
  typically be able to read all messages, no matter if Perfect Forward Secrecy
  is in place or not. Having access to a single device from a member of a group,
  will typically expose a lot of the social graph. Using e-mail addresses that
  are not easily tracked back to persons helps group members to stay safer from
  the effects of device seizure. 

- We are sketching ways to protect communications better against the event
  of device seizure. 


### How does Delta Chat protect my Metadata?

- As Delta Chat is a decentralized messenger, the metadata of Delta Chat users
  are not stored on a single central server. However, they are stored on the mail
  servers of the sender and the recipient of a message.

- Each mail server currently know about who sent and who received a message by 
  inspecting the unencrypted To/Cc headers and thus determine which e-mail addresses
  are part of a group. Delta Chat itself could avoid unencrypted To/Cc headers quite 
  and always put them only into the encrypted section. See 
  [Avoid sending To/CC headers for verified groups](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/issues/1032). 
  For opportunistic chats the main concern is how it affects other mail apps who 
  might participate in chats. 

- Many other e-mail headers, in particular the "Subject" header, are
  end-to-end-encryption protected, see also this upcoming [IETF
  RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-autocrypt-lamps-protected-headers/).


### Can I re-use my existing private key?

- Yes. The best way is to send an Autocrypt Setup Message from the other e-mail client. Look for something like **Start Autocrypt Setup Transfer** in the settings of the other client and follow the instructions shown there.

- Alternatively, you can import the key manually in "Advanced settings / Manage private keys". Caution: Make sure the key is not protected by a password, or remove the password beforehand.

Si no tienes una llave o ni siquiera sabes para qué la necesitas, no te preocupes: Delta Chat genera una según sea necesario de forma automática, no tienes que hacer nada.


### I can't import my existing PGP key into Delta Chat.

With a very good chance, the problem is that your key is encrypted and/or uses
a password. Such keys are not supported by Delta Chat.  You may remove the
passphrase encryption and the password and try the import again.  If you want
to keep your passphrase you'll have to create an e-mail alias for use
with Delta Chat such that Delta Chat's key is tied to this e-mail alias.

Format wise, Delta Chat supports common OpenPGP private key formats, however, it
is unlikely that we will support 100% of all private keys of any sources. This
is also not the main focus of Delta Chat (in fact, the large majority of the
Delta Chat users will not have any key before they start using Delta).
However, we try to support private keys from other sources as good as possible. 

Removing the password from the private key will be different, depending on the
software you use to manage your PGP keys. With Enigmail, you can set your
password to an empty value in the Key Management window. With GnuPG you can set
it [via the command
line](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/98#issuecomment-378383429).
For other programs, you can find a solution online.


### Why don't you use pEp (pretty easy privacy)?

- Delta Chat uses the Autocrypt e2e-encryption standard. For
  a discussion of Autocrypt and pEp, see the [Autocrypt
  FAQ](https://autocrypt.org/faq.html#how-does-autocrypt-differ-from-pep).


## Multi-client {#multiclient}

### Can I use Delta Chat on multiple devices at the same time?

If you want to use the **same account** on different (Autocrypt
capable) devices, you have to sync their encryption capabilities: 

- En el primer dispositivo, elija "Configuración avanzada / Enviar mensaje de configuración de Autocrypt" y haga clic hasta que aparezca un "número de seguridad".

- On the other device, wait for the "Autocrypt Setup Message" to
  arrive and click on it, which should prompt you for the security number. 

- You are now synchronized, and can use both devices for
  sending and receiving E2E-encrypted messages with your communication partners. 


## Miscellaneous

### Does Delta Chat work with _my_ e-mail-provider?

- With a rather good chance: Yes :)  
  However, some providers need special options to work properly,
  see [Provider Overview](https://providers.delta.chat)


### I'm interested in the technical details. Can you tell me more?
